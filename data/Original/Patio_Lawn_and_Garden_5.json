Upon unboxing the blower I could tell that it was built well with a lot of attention to detail.  I added regular motor oil to the crankcase and added gas.  Once the primer bulb was pumped and the choke was activated, the blower started on the first pull.  It is quiet as the other reviewers said and seems to blow just as well or better than my old blower.  The exhaust is clean which is nice when blowing leaves and dirt from my garage.  It has ALWAYS started on the first pull ever since.  Not having to mix the gas with oil is nice and saves an extra step.  Just a side note, Dolmar is owned by Makita and that is the brand that I have, it is identical to this one, just an red color, not blue.  You might be able to save some money with the Dolmar one as I did.\n\nUpdate: Three years later, the blower would not run correctly.  It started fine, ran okay for a minute or two then would stop running.  I replaced the carburetor, but it still will not run.  Be advised, not many outdoor power equipment repair shops are familiar with this blower and most say they cannot get any parts to repair it.  So now I am stuck with a dead blower.  I only used the blower sparingly, put in gas stablilizer, changed the oil once a year, so I am not happy with this brand.","summary":"Update: 2 years later...","unixReviewTime":1354147200,"style":null,"image":null}

We used it to create a small water feature for our patio with a wide, shallow planter. At first, we suctioned it to a bowl, positioned under the water, and it worked fine. But I wanted to see how it would do floating freely and found that the water sprays up much nicer. I'd guess because the solar panel recieves better sunlight when it floats on top. The bowl we are using is wide enough to keep the water from shooting outside of it so no complaints there. But we experimented a little with a taller, more narrow container and it sprayed out. So I definitely see why there is so much discussion about that. My suggestion is to use the extra suction with the string to anchor it down under the water. That seemed to be the difference for us in how high the water sprayed! I hope that helps! We thoroughly enjoy this!

That did not work as it is too big and needs a heat proof surface inside.\n\nIt was easy to put together except for three screws and hunted for a long time but found a place meant for four screws but only three provided.  Finally found this place but just the three screws.  I grilled chicken strips and they worked just fine. The chicken thighs I covered with seasoning and coconut oil so those worked the best.  It made for more clean up of the grids.  I was hoping the grid would come apart by itself for easy cleaning but not the case. The whole top has to come apart from the base and then remove the catch grease pan and it was easy then to be brought inside for cleaning.  I just used paper towels and it wiped up clean in no time,  Since I live alone like to grill a good supply and freeze them for a later meal.  I am sure I will use this grill many more times\n\nI like the way it looks as it is a good size grill and easy to keep looking good.

They arrived quickly, were well-packaged, and the color is pretty much as shown. Best of all, they really do keep the rooms significantly cooler.\n\nMy shades are 8 feet wide by 6 feet long, and I was able to mount them on stucco (real cement stucco not the foam stuff) by getting concrete anchors from Home Depot. After drilling the holes I filled them with outdoor caulk to keep water from getting in then put in the anchors.  They're holding up very well.\n\nI did order longer cords because the ones that came with the shades were only about 3' long and the bottoms of my shades are 4' off the ground - meaning I had to get a step-stool to reach the original ones. The longer cords came within a few days and are just right.\n\nMy shades did come with anchors to keep them from blowing in the wind and those work very well, even in the high winds we get in the afternoon.\n\nOne tip for anyone else mounting on stucco: get a regular masonry bit (I burned the tips off the ones that came with the anchors), and use a powerful drill. My old cordless Makita was so slow, and would run down the battery before I got 2 holes drilled - not fun when I was working from a ladder 10' off the ground in hot sun, so I got a corded drill which went through the stucco like butter.\n\nOh, one other tip: if you want to change the side the pull is on, be aware that there are tiny gear wheels that will fall out when you take the cover off if you're not careful :-(. Fortunately, I had a second one to use as a guide or I'd still be trying to figure out how to get them back in.","summary":"Love These Shades","unixReviewTime":1377820800,"style":{"Size:":" 8-Feet by 6-Feet","Color:":" Southern Sunset"},"image":null}

I received the Ohuhu Lawn Aerator Shoes at no cost in order to review and they are sturdier than I expected them to be. The green palstic is thick and strong as are the spikes.\n\nThese come unassembled but are easy to put together. A little wrench tool is included, but I found it faster and easier to use my needle nose pliers to tighten the nuts onto the spikes. There are three straps per shoe and a few different holes in the plastic shoes allow you to adjust the positioning of the straps to fit over your regular shoes. The straps each have a strong metal buckle.\n\nThese do a good job of breaking up the soil. Aerating is helpful for areas where dirt has gotten packed so tightly that grass can't seed in it and you get bare patches. When the soil is beated down and packed like that, nutrients and water have a tough time getting in as well. These are awesome if you have a smallish yard or a small area that needs some attention. We have way to much yard to walk all over in these, but I have been hitting some spots that have gotten beat down and packed and they have done good. I was surprised that these are actually pretty easy to walk around in. It's like wearing oversized sandals! I wear about a 7 1\/2 to 8 in regular shoes and have had no trouble with these. The spikes are very sharp and poke into that solid packed dirt pretty easily. The only trouble I have had is that after about 30 minutes or so, the straps loosen a little, making my regular shoes slip out of place and I have to stop to adjust and tighten them. Thanks to the dogs and their infernal digging, we have some uneven ground around the backyard but these have done real good as I walked over those areas. They are strong and haven't flexed or broken. I look forward to using these around the garden this summer.","summary":"Great For Breaking Up Compacted Soil","unixReviewTime":1462838400,"style":null,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/91SarjOb6CL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71hO77w-HQL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71pAupGo20L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/91IR9k-uGlL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Dy-ybIEAL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/91pxAChT5mL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/9197bKpfQWL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/91wFS4yOGtL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/914JyBZg-jL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/91vUDlhDyXL._SY88.jpg"]}

This is a lightweight, strong automatic \"Rainbow\" Plemo umbrella which has 8 different colored panels and opens and closes at the push of a button. The umbrella shaft length is about 11.5 inches long fully collapsed in its carry bag and 22 inches fully-extended from the tip of the strong handle up the aluminum shaft to the middle of the umbrella. The diameter of the fully extended umbrella spokes and fabric from side to side is 37 inches. The umbrella weighs 11.2 ounces\n\nIn testing, after the carry bag is taken off and the velcro strap is released to manually unfurl the collapsed umbrella fabric and spokes, pushing the \"Up-Down\" button automatically causes the umbrella to fully extend and then pop open in 1 second. Pushing the \"Up-Down\" button a second time causes the umbrella fabric and spokes to collapse back onto the shaft, only requiring the user to push on the umbrella top to collapse it back down the shaft, ready for using the velcro strap to secure the umbrella and placement back in the small carry bag for carrying or storage. There is also a carrying strap on the end of the handle.\n\nAfter opening and closing the umbrella 100 times, the automatic opening and closing mechanism performed flawlessly and the umbrella fabric and spokes stayed firmly in place.

I installed them on top of my flat roofed garage. I arranged them in 3 parallel sets of 4 in series. I reversed the inlet\/outlets of my pool first, because it seemed backwards. I now have one large intake to filter\/pump and two 1.25\" outlets back to pool. I routed one of the 1.25\" outlets through my solar array. I also installed valves on both 1.25\" outlet hoses and a tee to allow control of flow through the solar mats. I can force all supply water from pump, though solar mats and still get a 6* Fahrenheit temp rise on a 75* ambient day. I also purchased a solar blanket to retain that heat at night. I didn't have any problems with leaks due to factory connection, none of my seams leaked, and my water temp increased nicely. I try to read reviews of products through an idiot filter. Most problems with any product is a result from morons not following instructions, which seems to be a problem with these mats. I would, and probably will purchase more of these if they wear out in the future.\n\nTIPS:\n\n LEAKING CONNECTIONS - all the connections rely on an \"O-ring\" making a seal. Wet, and carefully rotate and slide hoses onto fillings. Most leaks are probably due to people cramming the hoses on.\n\nRIPPING\/BURSTING SEAMS - I have the stock pump for my Bestway pool. I am not sure of the flow rate, however, there is NO way I would divert all the flow through a single line of mats. This is most likely why seams bust. Also multiple mats in a parallel configuration allows for some relief if the flow is restricted due to a kink, or someone standing on the mat, which is also a likely reason for seam bursting.\n\nSIZING - If you do not purchase enough mats for your pool size it will never warm the pool due to basic physics. Also, purchase a solar mat to retain the heat! I  read that while it takes only one BTU of heat to raise the temperature of one pound of water, you can loose as much as 1100 BTUs per gallon of water through evaporation (or like 8 pounds of water).\n\nEXTRA PIPING - I purchased 25ft lengths of 1.25\" sump pump hose for my extra required piping for about $7\/25ft at my local hardware store. Use steel hose clamps one extra piping connections, and use a drill\/impact gun to tighten those extra clamps.","summary":"Worth every dollar","unixReviewTime":1506816000,"style":{"Color:":" Black"},"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/714QliiTHyL._SY88.jpg"]}

I have a fairly large hand with an 8.5-inch finger span (Yeah, I know - man-hands) and the large fits perfectly.  The green part is stretchy so they're easy to put on yet still hug the wrist so there's no annoying gap.  I bought the 2-pack so I can have one at the back door and one at the front for those impromptu walk out gardening or yard pickup events and the ones I bought previously are in the garage next to the lawn mower and in my workshop next to my bandsaw.

The ends are well attached to the hose and also have rubber washers included inside the end. the material is nice and thick around the inner hose.\n\nI would recommend when you use the hose to shut it off and wait a few minutes for the water to drain out, then it will be nice and light again and ready to roll back up.\n\nI recievd this in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","summary":"Works great and is so nice to have.-update-","unixReviewTime":1457740800,"style":null,"image":null}

It is relatively large (32 x 42\" inside + the nest box) and appears to be made from Chinese fir, a relatively light and soft wood. Assembled easily with a series of pre-installed dowels guaranteeing the proper alignment of panels. Instructions were poor - a series of diagrams, but adequate if you take your time and dry fit (no glue) the panels first to make sure you're assembling them properly.  The coop needed some minor additions to exclude drafts and to keep rain from penetrating the hinged seam between the nesting box lid and sidewall of the coop. Anyone handy with a saw , wood glue and clamps can quickly add strips of wood to do this. The vent in the upper half of the front wall also needed some work on the unit we received to ensure rain could not blow in when it was closed. We added some thin ply to enlarge the panel the door slides over to fix this. Latex paint to protect the wood and this makes a nice coop for 5 large chickens. Very happy with it with mods described.","summary":"good value and size","unixReviewTime":1394582400,"style":{"Size:":" 7 - 10 Chickens","Color:":" Brown"},"image":null}

I have done a lot of drip irrigation and this is the same tube. I was used to how it goes together. I did not use any boiling water or hair dryers. I just pushed the tubes onto the fittings carefully and with significant force. I would probably have been a bit frustrated with it if I hadn't done so much with drip irrigation in the past. The tube itself feels like nice, high-quality tube. I have had zero issues with it kinking. The tee fittings and spray heads are similarly nice. They do not break, and I had no problems with any of them leaking.\n\nThere is one part that I did have a problem with. The faucet\/hose connector on mine is terrible. It it very tight, and I cannot screw it down far enough to engage the o-ring seal. Due to this it leaks terribly. I've tried it on two different faucets and a hose, and I can't get it to seal on any of them. I glanced through the other reviews and didn't see much mention of this problem, so it's possible I got a bad one and all the rest seal fine.\n\nThis is a nice kit to set up a large mist-cooling system, but you may need to figure something else out for attaching it to a water supply. The tube is standard drip-irrigation tube, so there are lots of accessories readily available at your home improvement store. I will try to attach some pictures below. The water spray is very fine and doesn't show up well in pictures though. I got this kit for free to test and review. If my opinion changes I will update this review.

I owned the Flowtron MT-275 for 3 yrs. It did work and caught maybe 200 mosquitoes a month. Being my first ever trap I thought this was good. The unit finally stopped working after 3 yrs. I replaced the fan according to their support with no success. Flowtron support was clearly guessing at the problem and I decided to throw this unit out before spending any additional money trying to fix it. What a great move this was!!  Advice to all....throw your Flowtron out if you own one regardless if it is working or not! I recently bought a Mosquito Magnet MM3000 Liberty and a Blue Rhino SV3100 SkeeterVac. One was put on each side of my 3 acres. Within 2 wk both of these units caught more mosquitoes than the Flowtron did in 3 yrs!! After 3 months now, the Magnet Liberty is by far superior at catching mosquitoes, but that is all it catches, and it does it well! I empty a full bag every wk, which must be 1000's. The SkeeterVac catches about 1\/3 the mosquitos of the Magnet, however the TacTrap (sticky paper on the outside of unit) is excellent at catching other biting bugs, like the large black and green flies I have up here. After every 2 wks the TacTrap looks like a fully loaded pizza of bugs...very cool! The other nice thing about the SkeeterVac is that its cordless. However, the TacTrap and Fine Tune Biting (Octanol) will add to the monthly operational cost vs the Magnet. So far, following the advice of previous posters, I have not had any clogging problems. I replace the propane before it runs out so the units are not running on empty...which seems to be the main problem with these units. Bottom line, I like having both the Magnet and SkeeterVac units, and will never by a Flowtron again!","summary":"Comparison of Flowtron, Skeetervac and Magnet traps","unixReviewTime":1278720000,"style":null,"image":null}

But the record speaks for itself: I clicked the \"on\" switch on 3 consecutive nights and netted one dead mouse per night.  However, I must register one troubling observation: on this third morning there was a chewed-out gap of almost 1\/2\" in diameter in the plastic at the backside of the trap.  I had been led to believe the trap was capable of \"humane\" (i.e. instant) kills of each victim, but this morning's evidence would suggest that the out-manned prey was desperately trying to escape before or during electrocution.  Worse, if the latter is true, it's possible a demobilized, half-paralyzed creature was yet capable of using its teeth in a project that was doomed from the outset.  Amazon shows a popular live-kill green plastic mouse trap that I had to abandon because within several nights the critters had chewed it to pieces, managing to escape.  In the case of the damaged Victor \"electric chair\" it appears the mice have once again scored an ultimate victory against their worst enemy (me).\n\nI went ahead and used it the 4th night anyway.  This time there was no flashing green light indicating a kill because the shocked mouse fought hard enough to lift the latched cover and break the circuit.  So much for the claims about the trap being instant, or \"humane.\"  All the same, I set the trap a 5th time, and the next morning the flashing green light indicated a kill.  Not wanting to bury the animal in my pajamas (I was still in my pajamas making coffee, not the mouse), I set it to the \"off\" position, planning to attend to the grave matter at hand in an hour or two.  However, upon returning I discovered an open door, an empty trap, a trap moreover showing not the least trace of the peanut butter I had lathered it with the night before).  You draw your conclusions. Either I'm harboring exceptionally resilient rodents or Victor's Electronic Trap is close to a \"throwaway\" (maybe the electronic circuitry is effective at giving the mice a pleasant, rejuvenating massage).\n\nFor several reasons, this trap can be recommended over Victor's Kill & Seal mouse trap, and my investment repaid itself to the extent of 3 consecutive kills.  Still, I say shame on Victor for the wastefulness and misleading (paranoia-inducing) promotion of the Kill & Seal trap and for the inferior component (plastic) of the electronic trap.  Were this trap made of metal or a similar indestructible (by mice) and conductible material, it would appear to be the mouse exterminator's best bet.  But now that I'm embarked on a career of rodent homicide, it looks like I'll have to move on to something that's not worthless after the first 1-3 fatalities.  From consumers' reviews, the \"Nooski\" looks like it just may be the best bet (but stay tuned).","summary":"Victor Electronic Trap vs. Victor Kill & Seal (no easy solution)","unixReviewTime":1311811200,"style":{"Size:":" 1 Pack"},"image":null}

I have used these tubes for holding my pool cover for a long time.  I have ordered the single tubes and been very satisfied.  There was no reason to believe that I would not be just as pleased with this purchase.  The shipment arrived quickly and was perfectly packaged.  The address was from Robelle, so I was confident in the product.  It is made in China, but that's no biggie as long as it's well made.  I have received about 3 years of use from the old tubes and some were still in good shape, so I assumed these would do well.  The quality of the vinyl seems fine and the \"welded\" seams are good.  The tubes come individually wrapped.  I filled the first tube and tried to close it and that's when the problem showed up.  These normally fit snug and are sometimes difficult to open; but with a little urging, they usually close just fine.  Not this time. I have a pretty decent grip and it was a struggle for me to get the first tube closed.  It wasn't from weather either.  The temp is in the 60s today.  I had to work it around, keeping even pressure and push HARD in the middle to finally get it to close.  It was not the satisfying \"snap\" closure that all my other tubes exhibit.  I thought maybe it was a fluke, so I filled the second tube.  I have even more trouble with this one.  I had to squeeze and wiggle - and finally laid it on a flat surface and exerted a lot of pressure with the palm of my hand to get is closed.  I realized at that point, that I had made a mistake. These are normally a little tight when I try to open them in the spring and empty the water.  After closing the second tube, I realized that it was permanently closed.  It was too late to send them back, so I continued to the third tube.  I filled it and when I tried to close it, I realized that it was even harder than the first two. The opening had been put on the tube and was in an oval shape, but the closure plug is round.  They are slightly flexible, so I tried squeezing the shape, squeezing the plug - everything I could think of.  I got it close, with just about 45 degrees of the outside arch not closed and could get no further using every trick I knew.  I even tried stepping on it - about 200 lbs of pressure per square inch and it still wouldn't close.  Can't send them back and can't use them as they are.  I don't know if the one's I got were old and the openings were inflexible or if Robelle has changed Chinese manufacturers, but these are different from the ones I have received before.  A total waste on my part.  If I was evaluating the previous products, this would be a five star review.  Maybe your experience will be different from mine, but I would suggest a different brand or purchasing at the local pool store so you can see the product before you purchase.  I'm uploading a photo of the third tube so you can see the problem.  I hope this review is helpful.","summary":"Wasted my money - not like the ones I received before.","unixReviewTime":1450656000,"style":{"Size:":" 8-Feet - Deluxe 16g. - 6-Pack","Color:":" Blue"},"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/5149mjXpk6L._SY88.jpg"]}

It replaces the older 375 model and has more line capacity than it's predecessor. I comfortably fit 16+ feet of .105 into new 400 model- but more on that  later.\n\nI used this to save a pre-historic (by small engine standards)  Shindaiwa T250 whose original head went to head heaven after 18+ years of use. You gotta love the longevity of the older Shindaiwa motors. Mine still runs like a top after 1 or 2 pulls on the starter cord. I can only hope that tradition continues, now that they're part of ECHO, but that's a discussion for another day.\n\nOne of the included male by male adapters (the silver one with slotted end) instantly changed my gear drive connection to the correct male end that mounted the new speed head (original head is male- the speed head is female out of the box). There are many more adapters included, so you could probably hook up to the space shuttle- if were still flying. My only caveat is there still may not be enough adapters if you have trimmer from the big box guys-some of those have unobtanium trim heads.\n\n The web site said it would take .80, .95. or .105. ANYTHING bigger than .105 will not fit through the head (maybe the guides look big enough, but the internal passage is not). I threw out the supplied .95 string and used square cut .105 string. The included instructions do not mention .105 string. I can see why. The .105 is difficult to thread through the head(feels like it drags through the internal 'teeth'), and it 'bump feeds' unevenly. I can manually push on the dispenser and pull the measured amount of line by hand-but that could be a recipe for disaster with the engine running, and I don't recommend it.  I need the fatter line since my job has myriad stone walls, cement walks, and rocky soil. It just eats the smaller stuff. If you like the convenience of the bump however, stick to the smaller diameter lines.\n\nBecause your new head is probably a different weight and diameter than your old one, you may find the new trim head will not stop fully at idle. You will have to adjust your idle until the head just stops turning, otherwise you risk burning up the clutch. Please note you have been spared the full discussion on the moment of inertia or Newton's second law of motion.\n\nPlease resist the temptation for running without the string guard. When you increase the string 'orbit' past the 17-20\" range you burn more fuel to keep the rotational speed up. With today's CARB compliant engines, the increased fuel you put into the combustion process will clog or carbon-up something.  Most likely you have a 2-stroke engine, and there are a lot of variables when you make up that 40-1 or 50-1 fuel mix. Whether it's a spark arrester or the engine cylinder, your wacker will need attention.\n\nOverall, this saved me the better part of $300, as my trusty trimmer will wack another day.","summary":"Head of it's class","unixReviewTime":1378684800,"style":null,"image":null}

The female end after fully clamped and tightened to hose bib still leaks. Not much better than the one I tried to replace. My guess is the male and joiner clamps probably work better. The female seems to be leaking because it is two parts and appears to rely on the plastic washer to seal the two parts together. Whatever the cause, just does not work well. So got some useless parts, probably a few good parts, and should have spent the money just buying a new hose. Meanwhile I trained the dribble leak down to a plant next to the hose bib. Not \"premium\" if it does not fix the leak. Should add that I tried the repair because I had a very high quality hose, where the female end also failed shortly after the warranty expired. Gave it a two star (rather than one) because it does look like brass to me.\n\nUpdate: After sitting in the sun for a few days, (at 95 degrees +) both the hose and internal washer softened up enough to finally allow a very tight fit and no leaks. Originally put this on in evening when temperature was about 65. So with that knowledge will raise this to just what I was looking for.","summary":"Leak finally fixed.","unixReviewTime":1470009600,"style":{"Color:":" 1PK&#xFF0D;3PCS"},"image":null}

However, this is still a compromise.  Of course, it doesn't compare with a gas powered trimmer for raw power but, it's lighter and less fatiguing to use.  And, with the long charge duration before recharging, I can get a lot of work done before having to switch battery packs.  With the fast charger and two batteries, I could probably work all day with no down time.  It's pretty easy to justify the purchase of the fast charger if you have two or more 20V tools and\/or multiple batteries.  I have three 20V tools, two 2.0AH battery packs, one regular wall charger and one fast charger.  Suggestion for the manufacturer: The fast charger should be an option with the multi-tool combination kits or even with all 20V tools.  It's a shame to be stuck with a useless original charger if you decide to upgrade.  The net cost of the fast charger should be significantly less if purchased with the tool in place of the standard charger.  One negative I've encountered using the tool is that the string guard doesn't fully protect me from splatter when working in wet or muddy areas, especially in edger mode.

Of course it is THE tool to have to get weeds outta that crack in the concrete too. Just get one. You will find a use for it and you'll wonder what you ever did without one.","summary":"Gotta Have Onna These","unixReviewTime":1508630400,"style":{"Item Package Quantity:":" 1","Package Quantity:":" 1"},"image":null}

King","reviewText":"Various hearty weeds grow thickly around my fence lines and need frequent trimming.  I need a tool that's lightweight, easily portable and effective for a variety of things.  My string trimmer works for the grasses, but not the sturdier weeds and the blade trimmer works for those, but not the grasses, plus it's heavy and tiring to use.  I decided to try this little tool and am so glad I did.  It's great.  It's sharp and slices off the poke weeds in a flash and can handle things with pretty stiff stems, plus tall grasses when I grab a sheath of them by the tops.  The curved blade makes the effort required minimal. I was so pleased with the ease with which I was able to clear around the paddock fence, I set out with my folding saw and this tool to cover one whole side of pasture fence and it looks terrific.  Only three more to go :)\n\nThe trimmers are great for specialized tasks, but when I am trying to trim a variety of things, they seem more trouble than help as I have to make multiple passes.  While this tool can't manage the harder saplings, my little folding saw makes short work of those and carrying both this tool and that one is easy since both are lightweight.\n\nIt also makes my trail clearing activities much more productive as I was carrying clippers, loppers and the folding saw, which was a bit cumbersome.  Since this tool handles a good variety of things, I only need to pull the saw out for the bigger saplings and cedars.  Of course I don't get as close to the ground as I would with a trimmer since I don't want to be bending down all the way, but it's quite reasonable and since I'm less tired after using it, I don't resist going back out there when needed as I did at the thought of fussing with the eccentricities of the trimmers.\n\nAll in all, I consider this purchase money very well spent.  The zippered case is good quality and even has a protective plastic trough for the blade edge.  This little machete will get a lot use around the farm.","summary":"Poke weeds be gone!","unixReviewTime":1273104000,"style":null,"image":null}

I love not having to mix oil & gas and keeping that around in a separate container. However, my only comment about the engine is, it seems to take a while (5 minutes) to warm up and stay running. Thankfully I purchased the JumpStart(er) .. which makes starting (restarting) a breeze. Because of the engine and long warm up (or whatever the issue is) , this takes away 1 star. The reason for dropping another 2 stars, is because of the bump head (trimmer line). After only 20 minutes of trimming (long) grass, the bump head melted and started wobbling .. yes melted. I wasn't too concerned at first because I assumed I would just replace the bump head with a replacement head (Gator 8010) .. however, the bump head is not replaceable (at least, I cannot remove the head from the curved shaft). I've Googled and searched .. and found no way of removing the bump head .. which in the end, makes half of this purchase a total waste of money. Thankfully, my old 12 year old weed whacker (yes 12 year old Home Depot special), trimmer attachment fits just fine on the Troy-Bilt. It needed a new trimmer head .. so I purchased the (Gator 8010 - w\/ LoNoiz LN130MSP-2-professional .130 trim line) and (Gator 4680) and along with my other attachments .. can get back to my yard work. As a side note: I highly recommend the .130 trim line .. I've battled trimmer line for years with my metal fencing eating up the standard .095 line, feet at a time .. but with (slightly more expensive) .130 line, I finished off my fence line with only replacing 1 strand of 6\" line.","summary":"Overall a good purchase.

Morrison","reviewText":"After getting four standard \"Kink Free\" hoses from Ace Hardware, all of which kinked from their first use, I gave up on the standard type of hose, which is made of a pretty stiff material. I would always get into a situation where the hose would kink up upon itself and cut off the water flow. Then I would have to go back and manually unkink the hose, not always easy to do because of the stiffness of the standard hose material. Once the hose kinked in a spot, it was likely to kink again in the same spot, as a weakness had been permanently made at that spot, once kinked.\n\nI did see some disappointing reviews here on the green Pocket Hose (15 metre), but when I saw that it was available, I decided to give it a try. After all, the Ace hoses were impossible. I bought one for the front yard and one for the back yard, and did my usual hand-watering.  I was initially delighted!\n\nFirst of all, the weight of the hose is trivial compared to a standard hose, which can get a little tiring to lug around. As the product description indicates, the compacted hose filled with water to its full length. When I turned off the water, the hose contracted to a more compact form. True, it didn't compact back to the original compacted size, but to about a quarter of its full length, so that it could be stored easily below the water spigot.\n\nThe instructions indicate that in the summer the hose should be stored in the shade, and in the winter, inside, as in a garage. I don't know how important that really is. I'm just going to leave my Pocket Hoses outside under the spigot. But, then, I live in a mild climate. If you're regularly getting hot, direct sunlight or sub-freezing temperatures, the proper storage could markedly increase the life of the Pocket Hose.\n\nOne benefit that I did notice: the water flow was noticeably increased through the Pocket Hose as compared to the standard Ace hoses that I had previously used. I would attribute that probably to the fact that the standard hose is so stiff that it does not expand, whereas the Pocket Hose readily expands and contracts to reflect the actual water flow.\n\nUnfortunately, my delight abated when, within weeks, I experienced two defective hoses.  One leaked badly after a few weeks' use, and another exploded like a balloon.  The junction of the hose material with the plastic on the faucet end is badly manufactured, and the hose comes apart there.\n\nSince the 15-metre length was just a bit short for my use, I had been pulling the hose to reach.  Maybe this weakened an already-weak connector.  So I decided to try this hose, the blue Xhose (22.5 metres).  So far, this hose material seems more substantial.  We'll see whether the junction holds up.\n\n12\/02\/13.  I have now had two of these hoses go out within weeks of purchase.  As opposed to the green (15 metre) type, which tear at the connector joint after several weeks, this blue (22.5 metre) type is defective in the inner tubing, which tears and makes the hose gush from the tube.  The most recent one I tried gave out in just two weeks.  It is too bad that the quality control on these hoses is so bad when their basic concept is so good.","summary":"High Percentage of Defects","unixReviewTime":1375228800,"style":{"Size:":" 75 FT","Color:":" Blue"},"image":null}

I've never even put on the side shoot since mulching removes the need for yard cleanup (raking). I recently bought a new Poulan Pro riding mower but it was not setup for mulching. That's the reason I bought this kit. It was easy to install (Note: I've installed blades before). The installation instructions are clear to read, include pictures, are accurate and even include mowing tips. They also come in English, French and Spanish. The instructions specify how to replace the blades on a standard setup (Center Bolt) or if you have an EZ Blade Attachment System (Quick Release). It fits my Poulan Pro 42\" model: 960460077. My model number was not listed on the box but it fit perfectly. Supposedly there's more models in a \"Look-Up\" guide in stores.\n\nBlades:\nYou get two 21 inch blades in the kit which equal 42 inches total. They were exactly the same length of my OEM blades. The blades are of a good quality and match or exceed other aftermarket blades out there. The instructions nor the box state anywhere that the blades need to be sharpened, but they do seem dull to the touch. I have been told in the past that the paint that coats the blade to prevent corrosion covers the blade edge giving the illusion that it's dull. The paint then rubs off when mowing exposing the sharp edge. I have not found this to be true. I took them to my local hardware store to be sharpened and balanced and now they are sharp to the touch. I recommend everyone gets the blades sharpen before you install them.\n\nMulch Cover:\nThe mulch cover is plastic and is of the same quality and density of the OEM Poulan Pro side shoot. It attaches to the mower deck at the top via a metal tab underneath the side shoot and to the sides via rubber bungees. It fits the contours of my mower deck precisely and installation was easy. The only issue I had was if I started with the mulch cover in place I could not get the left bungee to stretch far enough to reach the mower deck mounting plate. When I attached the left side bungee first then stretched the mulch cover into place it installed with ease.\n\nNormally with a side shoot on the right you can only trim around things like landscaping from the left side of the mower deck. I went one step further and removed my side shoot. You have to disassemble the spring mechanism though. If you remove the entire assembly you will lose the metal tab at the top that secures the mulch cover. If you leave the side shoot on it just hides the mulch cover when it's down making it look like no changes were made. It does not interfere with the mulch cover at all.\n\nUpdate: 5\/9\/2016\nMulching:\nNo matter how fast or slow my mower is traveling, rows of cut grass deposit on the lawn leaving stripes I have to go over a second time. I believe this is due to clippings getting caught up somewhere under the deck causing the clippings to not distribute evenly. Also, the top of the deck collects a ton of clippings when mowing. This is the reason I dropped the review from 5 to 4 stars.","summary":"Now I can mulch!","unixReviewTime":1458000000,"style":{"Size:":" 1 Pack"},"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/813qIDw8YQL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81-gUnSTJDL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/818JqSx57RL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71rp-e3I6cL._SY88.jpg"]}

I have had a bat problem for 10 years. They love my vestibule area. They huddle in the corners. At one time the bats did migrate south so I would have maybe a 2-3 month respite. Then many started to stay all year. Now I have nothing against bats. They do a good job and I appreciate that. BUT, they make a mess with droppings near my paver front door area. Every night. And when I'm away, I come home to a big mess. Now I've tried many suggested remedies to keep them away. None worked. I was skeptical of product like this one...and there are several. Still, I was desperate. I set the switches for \"bat control\". There is a \"variable\" and \"constant\" mode. That's the high pitch that the bats (hopefully) don't like. I tried both. Constant worked better. Okay, the results. At first I continued to have a problem. I have a \"L\" shaped entry area so I tried various locations for coverage. After about 2 weeks I started to see a change. Fewer visitors. I did experiment with location and direction control. I have found that a location on the outside corner of my \"L\" area worked best. I also have adopted an upward slant to the box. Now that I've had several months to test, including a month away, I have had no nightly visitors. What a relief. This product has worked wonders for me. I highly recommend you give it a try. I'm not sure of the real coverage area when walls or other obstacles are in the path. But I also have a covered patio on the back of the house and in the past the bats used that as their base of operations. No longer. You need a power outlet for this product. It has continued to work flawlessly regardless of weather conditions. For me that means hot sun, high temps, cold (20-30 degrees) nights. No problems.","summary":"It Works","unixReviewTime":1501718400,"style":null,"image":null}

First, it has to be heavy duty enough to handle a big piece of meat without bending. Second, it can't rust if you forget it outside overnight. Third, no plastic trim that is going to melt in the fire. Right there, 90% of the sets marketed as Father's Day bargains fall short.\n\nI expected much more from Weber as a three-time owner (Genesis, bullet smoker and Smoky Joe). And these tools are a big disappointment. The design overpowers the function. They're great if you are a collector of Danish Modern but otherwise they are awkward to use and not really thought out. The tines of the fork can be bent with your fingers... not good. The tongs lack a clasp to keep them shut when they're not in use. Worst of all, the overall balance is off. They don't have that comfortable heft when you are using them and when you hang them on the pegs on the side of your Genesis the slightest jostle knocks them to the ground.\n\nThe day after I first used these I was in a big box store and saw a set from K*ngsford at half the price.

Would be five stars except for customer service and data formatting.  I had a technical question and called them.  When you get in the queue it is always 10 or 12 people ahead of you.  Takes about one half hour to get down to you.  I called three times because I got cut off twice when someone finally came on.  The third time the person could not answer my question and transferred me to another department...you guessed it...another queue with 12 people.  However, finally, that person knew the answer.\nThe .csv file header format requires some work to be presentable and the format illustration on the package has been massaged .  The problem is there is way too much data so it requires more work to get an average or mean for data plotting.  I am working on a spreadsheet to do this for me.  I purchased this unit from Costco (02064c), very reasonable.\n\nUpdate:  Three months later.  The CSV file is more than \"requires some work,\"  The data is totally honked up.  The temperature data is 12 hours out of sync with the time (the high temp is at midnight and the low temp is at noon, and the clock is correct).  The Date\/Time column is in reverse.  In order to make it correct you have to sort the Date\/Time column bottom to top.  Rain has its own Date\/Time column which is in the correct order but the rain data is confusing as it lists countless entries with the same data.  Why another Date\/Time column?  Just list the amount of rain that accumulates.\nI called tech support on this issue.  They related that, yes, the CSV file has difficulties and are working on the problem and will inform the user when a corrected version is available.  When is TBD.  The problem is not with the raw data from the console unit but the AcuRite Connect software.\nSolution:  I deleted the AcuRite Connect software and loaded the older AcuLink software.  Works great!  Rain data is cumulative and uses the same Date\/Time column.  The temperature curves are right on.  Aculink also displays real time data that AcuRite does not.\nBottom line:  Do not install AcuRite Connect.  Install AcuLink.

The photo isn't the smaller 48 sqft model its the larger model. The actual filter housing is a much better and slightly thicker material. My old filter housing was more like a PVC than fiber resin. The clamp on my old filter had a single hinge and the new model has two hinges on the metal clamp making it easier to install or remove. The coating on the metal clamp is better than my old clamp and the clamp bolt no longer uses a tension spring. The clamp has a sheathed copper insert where you tighten the bolt. The rubber o-ring is not round its square and feels like it has silicon material added. The gauge is better in my opinion, has low\/hi setting adjustments and although the valve is still plastic as was the old system its a better design. I only wish there was a over pressure  release valve option that would open if pressure exceeded 30+ psi. My old Hayward back-flush valve was a direct fit with no modification needed to fit this newer model. I had just bought new filter grids for my old DE4800 but they are the exact same grids that came with this newer model, so I have a spare set. The interior guts look to be the same. To me its just a DE filter but with the better housing material, better clamp, better gauge and compatibility with the older grids I feel makes this a great product.

This has led to the roof splitting the full width. The first of my 2 houses fell to the ground with exception of the 1 inch strip of roof and the cable. The second remained hanging with the interior being exposed. I put the pieces back on and installed 2 nails that physically bonded both roof pieces together.

In Upper East Side Manhattan, even the nice places have some level of mouse and cockroach activity. The goal is to manage this as opposed to eradicate. My son had presumed there would be cockroaches and mice in the property since this is A) common, and B) there were traps for both in the apartment when he rented it.\n\nTo his surprise and pleasure, he has found no vermin using these sticky traps in the last three weeks of use. He has placed them under the sink and in various other locations looking for vermin and has found none. Further, he has seen no alternate evidence, either (e.g. fecal material). Thus, these traps are fulfilling at least part of their value, which is to show the absence of vermin as well as the presence.\n\nI am only giving this product three stars for now, because it seems like a good idea, it is conveniently packaged and it does not carry the difficulties of some loose bait poisons or spring traps. On the other hand, it is also unclear why it has attracted NOTHING. After having seen his apartment, I can't believe that there is not any kind of ant, bug or whatever that would end up in this sticky stuff. Perhaps it is actually UN-attractive to them? In any case, we will revise it up a star or two if and when something gets caught. Additionally, he is taking one to work to check and see if the office mouse can be deleted (there is one, apparently.).","summary":"even the nice places have some level of mouse and cockroach activity","unixReviewTime":1428278400,"style":{"Size:":" 6-Pack"},"image":null}

Very easy to assemble out of the box with excellent storage of everything you need other than the water hose tp provide water to the unit.  The first time I used it for several hours and finished I discovered that the soap container had come loose.  Upon closer inspection I found that under the lower front orange plastic piece that runs from side to side there is a plastic projection hanging down through which the soap container is screwed.  The rear of the soap container is supported via a groove in it's back which fits 180 degrees around the wheel axel.  The screw had ripped out of the bottom of the plastic handing section for it on the lower front.  I had to remove the entire lower orange plastic piece on the front (family easy and straight forward) and then reposition the soap container to the other side of the unit, replace the lower orange plastic piece and then screw it through another hanging screw hold on the underside of the lower front orange plastic piece.  I also taped the back of the soap container so it could not slide around on the axel as it apparently had during my use of the machine.  This is a major design flaw and needs to be fixed by the manufacturer.  Thankfully there was a second hole I could use to secure the soap holder.  They also need to put retainers on each side of the rear of the soap container where it connects to the axel to keep it from moving around so much and causing the single screw holding it in place to rip out of plastic!  Were it not for this I would have given it 5 stars as the machine does clean easily, is easy to operate, starts on first one or two pulls and runs flawlessly!\n\nAnother problem was I copied the Serial Number from the box label and then I found it \"engraved\" on the lower right side of the motor and they matched.  When I attempted to register it on line it refused to accept it.  I called and the operator at Generac said it wasn't the serial number and might be the motor number.  Now I'm a 74 year old man and don't get down very well.  I went back to the shop and crawled on my stomach and finally found a sticker on the lower right side of the machine but because of the steep angle of the surface it was pasted onto I couldn't read the necessary numbers.  So I removed the spray wand and machine hose, then lifted it up onto my work bench.  Then I had to get an old milk crate to sit on and using a flashlight was finally able to record the proper serial number.  About the only thing they could have done to make it harder to find would have been to put it on the bottom of the machine!  Then I had to take it back down and put the wand and hose back on their very good carriers.  Of course as a result, having a bad back for which have to take narcotics to control the pain, I had to take an extra dose of pain meds to regain pain control!\n\nI then attempted to register the machine on line again but when I entered the \"Date Ordered\" from the \"Packing List\" from Amazon their screen refused to accept it stating it was prior to their invoice!  So I ended up having to call them again and a nice lady registered it for me, but told me she couldn't take any comments about the machine and the problems I incurred!  Another reason for 4 stars.

We turned down the water pressure as much as possible and that seemed to help to keep the top on.\n\nIt seems to be cheaply made, lots of plastic.  But, I guess if it was more sturdy the price would even be higher.  You need soft dirt to get this thing in the ground.  But, wait!  It better not be too soft as this thing is a bit top heavy and it will tilt!  If you have hard dirt, just forget it.  You'll never get the stake into the ground.  As it is, we got it in the ground, but it doesn't sit in the ground well.\n\nWe have had some fun playing with the sensitivity.  If it's not sensitive enough, it won't go off even when we walk in front of it.  If it's too sensitive, it will go off when people walk by on the sidewalk (we have it in the front yard).  But, we can work with the sensitivity settings.\n\nThe biggest problem\/concern for us: no on\/off switch!  How much could a switch have cost to be added to this?  When we do yard work, have the gardener come, or the kids come over, we have to turn the water off to it and then we need to trip it (walk in front of it) for it to release the water pressure it has in it.  Also, even though the water is not flowing to it, the thing still senses movement in front of it and will go off.  No water will spray but it's a darn waste of batteries.  Yes, I could set the sensitivity to low, but the sensitivity is so hard to get right, I don't want to mess with it!\n\nWe are using this but it's been very difficult getting it to work for us.

The thought of growing their own mushrooms was a novel idea to them. I had done a button mushroom kit long before they were born and had been meaning to order one of those, but then I saw this. Way cooler than white button mushrooms.\nThe kids did most of the prep, cutting it open, soaking it, and misting it daily. We started seeing growth in only about 3 days. After seven days, we had 1\/2 a pound growing out the side of the box. It was really quite amazing seeing this shelf of mushrooms sticking out from the box. I went to get the camera, but by the time I came back it had been cut off, cut up, and sent to the pan for some stir-fry daddy was whipping up. It was delicious and the kids loved eating it because they grew it.\nNow we get to flip it around to the other side and grow some more. Yay!\nDefinitely a neat, easy project for the whole family. It's pretty cost effective too. If I had been around for the cutting, I would have tried just cutting off the big mushrooms - not the whole \"shelf\" and letting the smaller ones grow larger.

The materials are exceedingly flimsy. Rest assured, before assembly is complete you would have added more dents and scratches, it is unavoidable..\n\nAssembly: Despite my scepticism, once assembled it was pretty sturdy. Assembly requires placing numbered parts together. The problem is all the parts are not numbered, so there had to be some guess work. Assembly definitely requires two people and takes about six hours. (Be sure to use the small plastic washers on every screw to create a water-tight seal and prevent rust.) Take careful note of the door track installation -- you dare not get it wrong. Despite contradictory video on their web site the floor assembly is done last and is placed inside the structure after it is assembled. To install the plywood floor you need to slide it in and put the narrow end in first (on the left side when facing the shed), then lower the right side. Do not attempt to put the rear end in first, you will damage the unit. On completion i had a bag full of screws, nuts and bolts left over. (My guess is they supply enough also to cover a larger shed.) It is not ideal for placement flush against a fence. The unit was assembled and then needed to be moved. (Not a big deal.) Despite all precautions, the door does not slide easily and the door handle does not align with the corresponding fixture on the door jam. (I've probably done something wrong but cannot figure it out.)\n\nValue for money: Depending on how long it lasts, it is excellent value for money. The floor frame kit, by comparison, is hopelessly overpriced.\n\nOverall: It is proving to be very useful and has a good appearance. I do not like the dark roof which makes it absorb heat. I would much have preferred it had the roof been white. I am almost tempted to paint the entire unit immediately to prevent rust. The walls are so thin that rust would immediately imply a hole and it already has several scratch marks where rust could set in. A paint job would be bound to improve its longevity. If i had it to do over again i would still buy this shed.\n\n[I was disappointed with the way Amazon handled this sale. The order was placed and a tracking number issued, but it did not track. After some time elapsed i learnt it was out of stock. They made no effort to place me on a waiting list or indicate when it would be back in stock. Meanwhile they delivered the floor kit. I ended up buying it from Wayfair, and no sooner had done so than Amazon were again offering it at $20 less. Incidentally, many vendors offer the unit, many at double the Amazon price.]","summary":"Practical for my Purposes.","unixReviewTime":1496448000,"style":null,"image":null}

We ordered two as we intend to have one \"cooking\" as we load the second one.\n\nFirst the bad news.  Shipment of the product was less than idea as both boxes appeared to have been to hell and back.  Parts were actually sticking out of one box and as we carried the box inside, additional parts fell out of the box.  Surprisingly and to our benefit, no parts were actually missing..  This may be more of an issue with the shipping facility.  The major negative issue is the assembly.  There are a significant number of holes that need to be drilled (approximately 80).  While the manufacturer did provide \"dimples\" as to where the drilling should occur, how difficult would it have been for the manufacturer to have pre-drilled all the required holes?  Another issue is that steps #2.8 and #2.9 are in the wrong sequence.  It makes much more sense to perform these two steps between 2.22 and 2.23.  This would eliminate step 2.10.  Another issue is that at times this is a two person job, specifically when assembling parts to the side panels.  The instructions should make this clear.  As mentioned before we purchased two of these products.  It required over four hours to assemble the first, and about three hours to assemble the second.  We are not inexperienced in assembling items.\n\nThe good news:  Once assembled the product seems to be very stable and solid.  Assuming we use it properly it will completely satisfy our requirements.  The large (and removable) hinged door will work quite well as we can position our little trailer underneath and dump out all the compost in one fell swoop.\n\nThe quality of this product is a five.  The assembly is a two at best.  I lowered the rating to a four as the assembly is a one time thing.","summary":"Great product but hard to assemble","unixReviewTime":1490832000,"style":{"Color:":" Black"},"image":null}

Perennial rye will germinate very quickly in most situations, and will grow more vigorously than most other types of grass (please note that I am located in the upper midwest), but it has it's drawbacks. This type of grass tends to grow much faster than fescue or bluegrass. Unless your lawn is all ryegrass, any patching done with perennial rye will need to be mowed more often. You often hear the recommendation that you should never remove more than 1\/3 of the length of the grass when mowing; well with perennial rye, you would need to mow every other day if that's your criteria (no, I am not kidding). By mid-summer, this rye will go completely dormant, or even die if temperatures are too high for too long.\n\nAfter many years, I've come to the conclusion that fine fescue is probably the best choice for lawns in my area. Fescue doesn't need to be mown as often, and seems to survive sun, shade, and warm weather better than rye. Yes, fescue takes longer to get established, but once it is, it's lower maintenance. Your mileage may vary; depending on where you live, other varieties may be better for you.","summary":"Try in a small area before planting large areas with perennial rye.","unixReviewTime":1463875200,"style":{"Size:":" 7-Pound"},"image":null}

(Yes, I actually have a cast iron stove installed.) It doesn't take a lot of wood to heat up the inside of the motorhome, but the labor involved using a handsaw and axe was more than I was accustomed to.\n\nI did not want to purchase a gas chainsaw for a number of reasons. I don't like to store gas in the trailer I pull behind my motorhome, and I have found that gas powered chain saws are notorious for not wanting to crank. Trying to keep the motor tuned and running on a gas saw can be a real challenge.\n\nUntil I came across this electric saw on Amazon I did not know that battery powered saws had advanced to such a degree. The reviews impressed me, and this saw was less than half the cost of the similar 40 volt chain saw sold by Oregon.\n\nHaving used the saw to cut up a large section of oak tree, I can say that I am extremely impressed. The power was significant, and I truly did not discern that this saw was in any way less capable than a similar size gas chainsaw. It cut through the hard oak wood quickly. The chain tensions extremely easily, and is self oiling. The saw has a nice solid feel to it. The weight of the battery is similar to the weight one might have from a small gas engine, and the 40 volt battery has plenty of juice to lay in a good supply of firewood.\n\nAfter running the battery down, I found that it fully recharged in 90 minutes, which is far quicker than many similar products. I am very happy with this saw. It appears to be a great product, and I am delighted to not have to purchase or store gasoline, or tinker with small engines to keep them running.","summary":"Good-bye Axe and Saw","unixReviewTime":1357344000,"style":null,"image":null}

My expectations are higher.\nWeak door design to handle water ingress and frequent freeze\/thaw cycles.\nRainwater can and will fill the base.\nAbsolutely the poorest design to collect runoff.\n\nThere's a spout on the base yet you have to take the barrel off to use it?  These types of instructions almost appear as an edit once they realized that you will get nothing from the spout unless it's pitched 30 degrees or more.  I don't buy their comment that people complained about getting their hands dirty when opening the spout - the solution is buy a $.99 garden hose valve yet this still doesn't solve the fundamental weakness of the base. The flow from the spout is so anemic that it took me 20 minutes to empty the base to 40% by standing it vertically.  Yes that's right. The base will never fully empty no matter how much you try and standing the base vertically while shaking it caused a few wheels to fall off (which are easy to put back in place but it shouldn't happen in the first place).  And for the older\/weaker part of the population, lifting 20-30lb for 20 minutes just to get 1-2 gallons of \"tea\" may not worthwhile or possible.  I'm surprised a prototype never revealed this glaring flaw and disappointed that they decided to proceed with production and sell it at a premium price.  Does it compost?  Yes, very well but so do a dozen other tumblers - compost tumbling is not rocket science.","summary":"I'm glad I didn't buy two.","unixReviewTime":1503273600,"style":{"Size:":" 35 US Gallons","Color:":" Black"},"image":null}

Couse","reviewText":"UPDATE:  3\/31\/15\n\nSo for those of you that are late to this party, it originally started out as a 1 star review.  The bridge kept disconnecting and even a replacement did the same.  So what made it go to a 5 star??  Read on.\n\nMy review immediately caught the attention of AcuRite\/Chaney Instruments Consumer Operations Manager, who reached out to me via email about my experience with this product.  He wanted me to call him back and give him a time where we could actually visit about the problem I was having.  Seriously...what company does this nowadays?  Only the best companies do this.  AcuRite and Chaney DO THIS.  To make it even more astonishing, this cat gives me his PERSONAL CELL PHONE number to call him on.  Which I promptly do and catch him on his way home from a long day at work.  Yet he answers my call (this was after 7:00pm I believe) while driving home and we visit about how to fix this problem.  He tells me that his best tech will be in touch...just give him a time to call.  So I did.  And guess what?  The best tech ACTUALLY calls me at the time I said.  This guy wastes no time and within 2 minutes says, \"Yep.  I'm sending out a new unit, I will personally test it for a couple of days, and then will ship overnight.\"  How awesome is that.  None of this check this, did you do that, what about this...nope.  Just a sure fire answer that a new one is on the way.  Well guess what?  The new one shows up like he promised!  I go through the setup procedures and unfortunately it disconnects again.  Now I'm feeling a little bad...like, there is NO WAY I get 2 defective units.  This problem has got to be on my end.  I reach out to the manager and indicate that something is still not working, he's not happy and the first tech is out sick today, but they have backup experts...oh yes they do :)  In the meantime, I send them my router info, internet connection company info etc...and on the same day I hear from the other expert.  \"Mr. Couse, I took the liberty of calling the manufacturer of your router and talking to their tech support and I think we have a solution\".  What?  Are you serious??  You called the other company instead of making me do it?  \"According to Belkin, you need to reset your router to factory defaults and that should do it.\"  Now honestly, at this point,I'm like sure...that's like the IT department calling and saying reboot all the time :)  But hey, if this individual took the time to call and wait for Belkin's support team, then I'm all for it.  So she warns me that I'll have do the whole song and dance of setting up my router after the restore, but hey, that's no big deal.  So I do that and BINGO! this bridge has not missed a beat since.\n\nTotally and utterly ridiculous customer service!  I won't put their names here, but I know they pay attention to these reviews...so a big KUDOS TO YOU J, M and V!\n\nOriginal review posted below:\n\nThe only reason one buys this device is to be able to track your \"backyard\" weather remotely.  Whether it be via their app, or uploading data to wunderground and looking at all of the cool data at that website.\n\nInitially, setup was a breeze.  I followed the directions to a tee and it was up and reporting data to their web based software in no time.  After registering my location with wunderground, I was able to have the station start reporting my data!  Albeit, in 15 minute intervals and not \"flash updates\" like pricier stations from Davis that send updates every 2 seconds or set intervals that the user chooses.  15 minutes is just fine for my needs however.\n\nAfter about day 3 of flawless performance, I check my station at work on wundergound and it said \"not reporting\".  Odd I thought, so when I got home I checked out the bridge and noticed that the 2 blue lights were steady (not blinking) meaning only one of 2 things...it was either downloading another firmware update (it does this when you first register it) or it was rebooting...turns out it was rebooting.  Went to bed a little frustrated, woke up and the unit had started reporting again.\n\nNow tonight, the unit is again not reporting and is apparently stuck in a reboot cycle as I see 2 steady lights for a few minutes, then they blink again, then they go steady and then they blink.\n\nSo for now, I'm not sure if I should reboot the bridge which may or may not require me to re-register the device and may cause problems.  Since it sends data to Acu-Rite servers, which are then pushed to wunderground servers, I don't know if the problems lie within the Acu-Rite servers being down or not.  There is some chatter about Acu-Rite servers having issues, which is why they limit the data blast to every 15 minutes rather than seconds or minutes like other companies.\n\nI'm actually more disappointed in this device now after writing the review and \"seeing\" my words come to life rather than just my head with the experience I am having.\n\nAlso be aware that you MUST have an open port on your router for this device to plug into.  It is not wireless connection capable.  So if you've got your smart TV, blu-ray, Xbox, network drive, or others hardwired in, just know you're going to have to make some concessions.\n\nI may give it a few more days to see if it either gets better, or if the servers are the problem.  I've not had any internet issues so I'm a little snarky with Acu-Rite right now.\n\nUPDATE:  3\/20\/15\n\nThe device continues to fail to connect and update data.  The lights stay solid...then flash...then solid...then flash.  For whatever reason, this device worked great for 3 days and then has crashed and burned.  I've reset the modem, the router and this device to no avail.  I'm convinced it is the device or their servers that are causing the problems as none of my other internet connected devices (whether it be cabled to the router or wireless) are having any issues except this device.\n\nYou'll see the WU site indicating that \"this PWS is not reporting\"...it should actually read \"this POS is not reporting\"","summary":"Unfreaking-believable customer service!

Once I found these granules that absorb water and gradually release it into the soil, the watering has been reduced to a manageable level.  A good watering will plump the granules up so they can do their job over time and relieve me from having to hold the hose endlessly.\n\nYou do have to be careful not to add too much of the product and to work it well into the soil.  An over-eager addition in a new vegetable garden once, followed immediately by an abundant rain, left a layer of gel on the surface, which didn't help my plantings.  I learned my lesson however, and follow package directions now.  This is a great product and really helps keep a lovely and fruitful garden in dry conditions.  It's also super when planting new shrubs, as they will get a better start because of the gradually released moisture.  The granules in the soil last quite a long time.

Yes, it is that good of a method for controlling Jap Beetles.  I have an orchard of 22 fruit trees.  The Jap Beetles seem to LOVE Cherry and Plum trees foremost, and they like apple and peach somewhat less.  They also LOVE grapes.  I've used insecticides with limited success.  Having too much ground to cover with a ground\/grub based insecticide, spraying the trees was what I though was the next best option since the trees are too big to capture the ravenous bugs by hand.  But again, spray only worked so well and usually only for a short time.  Trees were still being eaten alive.  So I bought 6 of these traps and put them on the fence line on the north side (wind is predominately from the southwest).  BINGO!!!  I've been dumping the captured bugs in soapy water by the 10's of thousands.  And there are only stragglers left on the tree which are not a problem.  I plan to buy even more of these now that I've implemented this wonderful solution.  Note:  the accordion bottom detaches easily from  the upper part and you can dump the bugs into soapy water and then reattach.  EASY EASY EASY!!!  The bad models might work but if you don't dump them daily then the dead bugs will start stinking and defeat the lure.  Try this product and you'll see how well they work.

My neighbor on one side calls rats \"those really BIG mice\".  Hmmm.  I think you mean \"rats\".  My neighbor on the other side says \"I saw *your* rat walking on *my* wall again last night\".  Good grief.  C'mon man, that structure between our homes is \"our\" wall (yours and mine!).  And unless you see a collar with my phone number on it, the rats walking on *our* wall must be *our* rats.\n\nSo yeah, rats happen.\n\nI've tried lots of different solutions.  Poison bait is probably the most effective for controlling them in the yard, but that's really risky when there are pets in the yard.  So non-poison bated traps are the safest solution for us, as long as we keep the traps away from areas where the pets can get to them.  I don't like traditional traps though, because they're risky to set, tricky to bait, and not especially effective.  Many times I've found the bait missing and the trap still set--or even the trap sprung but no dead rat.\n\nI really like this trap though.  It's very easy to bait the trap BEFORE you arm it.  There's a hole in the top jaw that lets you fill the bait cup.  Once the bait is in place, just push down on the arming lever to latch the spring down.  Make sure the trap is where you want it first, because it's too dangerous to move it once it's set.\n\nI've experimented with different baits.  I first tried creamy peanut butter.  That was OK, but it dries out after a few days and isn't as effective.  Then on a lark I tried a spoon full of gunk from my barbecue's drip pan.  It looks pretty gross, but I know that rodents are really interested in the grill.  This works great.  I've had very good luck reloading the trap with BBQ drippings and reusing it.\n\nI've also had mixed success with lemon wedges.  The biggest attraction for rodents in our yard is our lemon tree.  They love the vitamins from the lemon peels.  I don't think the lemons put out the same smell as the food drippings though.\n\nAnyway, this trap is really effective.  I've never seen the bait taken without the trap catching its prey.  And the trap's jaws are wickedly strong. It's a quick (but messy) end to Mr. Rat.\n\nKilling the rats one at a time like this is slow business, but I've definitely seen their numbers decrease.","summary":"Outstanding Trap","unixReviewTime":1306281600,"style":{"Package Quantity:":" 1"},"image":null}

We had ants, termites and fleas we needed to deal with. We got the Hb and the Sc verities. The Hb is listed as good for termite queens, ants, and adult fleas as well as many others. Hb stands for Heterorhabditis bacteriophora.\n\nI applied as soon as we received the nematodes and used them in a bit more concentrated then then was directed. The termites we had in an old tree and one wall haven't been seen since. The cat didn't have any fleas to speak of for ages despite this being a major flea area.\n\nThe ants have been our major pest. Since we moved here we had been feeding them borax and sugar or Aspartame. Despite continually poisoning them they just kept coming. Found out we have Argentine Ants that have multiple queens making it next to impossible to wipe them out.  Long story short the ants disappeared for months. Not a single ant for months. We couldn't believe it hardly. Talked to the neighbors who all have ants and have been poisoning and or trapping them with no end of the battle in sight. They all wanted to know about the beneficial nematodes. At least two neighbors are planning on getting some after hearing about us not having them for almost a full year.\n\nWe applied it in the middle of May and only now next January are we finally seeing ants again. We will be buying more in a month or two as the weather gets a bit warmer. Worked incredibly well.\n\nUPDATE 2018: Still loving these things.

I filled the baskets with unlit charcoal, placed them on one side of my grill's charcoal grate, then put about seven well lit coals on top of each basket. The result was a slow burn that never got too hot and stayed in the 225-350 degree range for a couple hours - could have gone longer if I had not been opening the lid frequently after the first 30 minutes or so. I use the Old Smokey 22\" grills. Granted, I could have achieved mostly the same effect without the basket, but the basket makes for easy concentration, containment, and placement of the coals, with very easy cleanup. Also, I believe putting the two baskets together (long sides joined) and filling both with lit coals would give you a very high heat area directly above for searing, yet still give you room to the sides for indirect heat (at least on a 22\" grill). Hopefully these last as well as my Weber charcoal chimney, which is going on six years with no real signs of wearing out.","summary":"Great product.","unixReviewTime":1403568000,"style":null,"image":null}

During the summer months there is not much of a mouse problem, and also the rat snakes take out any nest or mice anyway. But temps have fell off. This trap is sitting there forgotten, no bait, but still plugged in. When i walked into my dark shop, I seen the blue light flashing and heard the buzzer signalling a kill. I was hurrying so just dumped the dead mouse and reset. It killed two more with no bait. Bumping to five stars.\nMy thinking is that when they come the factory, there must be a oil residue to protect from rust or was on the metal used to build. Once that wears off with humidity or wear,this trap becomes far more lethal.\n_______________________________________\nupdate:October 2016. Went into my shop and the blue light was blinking. I checked and sure enough, a mouse is in there dead.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKilled one mouse March 21, 2016 update changed from 1 star to three stars\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE December 29 2015: The company contacted me and sent me a 99% off coupon to try the trap again. Once it is here. I will update again.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE: February 15, 2016: The company did send me a new trap with a 99% discount. So once again I placed it in my garage with bait around the trap as well as  inside the trap leading to the bait tray, and once again all bait is eaten except for what it is in the trap's bait tray. This indicates that the trap does shock, but does not kill the mouse. So to further the experiment, I bought brand new , yet old fashioned snap traps and placed around the garage including one right beside this $70 zapper. Every snap trap has a mouse in it, yet the Zapper is still empty with the bait still inside. I place bait inside the trap but before the bait cup and that bait is gone. I wish this trap would work, but it just will not kill mice.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst day the bait was gone in less than an hour. No mouse. Just dusty mouse foot prints.\nTwo hours later, bait gone again and no mouse killed. Mouse foot prints.\nRead the reviews here trying to find a tip, and did stating to clean the trap well incase of oil residue. Another tip said to place a wet paper towel in front of it. So, I placed more bait in the trap and put the wet paper towel in front of the trap so the mouse has to walk over the wet paper towel to walk into trap but bait was gone,and dirtier foot prints in trap.\nNext I switched to peanut butter so the mouse would take longer and be touching moist peanut butter that may conduct electricity better. Still no mouse. At $69.00 this is the worse purchase I have made. I returned it today for a refund. I am going back to the standard 50 cent snap trap which I hate. But it works and this trap does not.","summary":"Killing mice regularly now. Bumping to five stars","unixReviewTime":1450396800,"style":null,"image":null}

The album contains poignant pieces that resonate with purity, complemented by flugelhorn, violin and cello. Even the song titles are as fresh and unpretentious as the music itself. Available as an award-winning Hybrid from Grammy-winning Norwegian producers, 2L.\n\nStone Rose heralds the arrival of a remarkable new talent in the new age piano music world. Cuddling up to watch a peaceful snowfall, reveling in the sanctuary of an empty church, taking respite in the quiet of a city park; these are the soothing gifts Gjeilo gives with his solo piano debut, Stone Rose, which entered the New Age music market in 2008.\n\nStone Rose is like a musical garden, an empathic glimpse into Gjeilo's heart. In the years during his early success as a composer and concert performer, Gjeilo internalized and processed memorable landscapes, cities and people, finally channeling them into musical expressions. Inspiring, passionate, sensitive, these many forms of love provided the groundwork for the intuitive compositions he presents in Stone Rose.\n\nRecorded by GRAMMY-nominated Norwegian label 2L in an old church in Oslo, Norway, one senses the soulful resonance of the old wood, hushed tones, and smooth cool stone floors beneath the recordings. Gjeilo's works seem to float freely in their own time, sometimes playful, other times introspective, always unhurried. His composition style for Stone Rose was improvisational, composing by ear and fitting music to subject, whether it was his mother or New York's Hudson River; in fact, in \"The Hudson,\" they were one and the same.\n\nThrough his publicist, Beth Ann Hilton of The B Company, Gjeilo explains, \"Fort Tryon Park by the Hudson River in New York is where I sometimes go to rest and rejuvenate; the water there has a very flowing quality that reminds me of my mother and our shared love of the water. I remember there was a glimmer on the water that day, which you might hear in the music.\"\n\nHis gentle, sincere style has matured from a musical pedigree that includes London's Royal College of Music and The Juilliard School of Music, following an early education in jazz and classical piano at the Norwegian Academy of Music in Oslo, Norway.\n\nEntertaining and relaxing, this warm and reflective piano music is subtly accented by flugelhorn, cello and violin played, respectively, by Tom Barber, David Coucheron and Johannes Martens. Listeners having \"one of those days\" will find solace in the same place as those looking for a unique love song, in the musical garden of the Stone Rose.\n\n\"In Norway, I grew up in appreciation of nature,\" Gjeilo explains, adding \"`Snow in New York' reflects the magical quiet I felt upon waking to the snow falling like a hush in New York City; `Roxbury Park' captures the tranquility I felt in this little park I'd go to relax near my place in L.A.\" The quicker, lighter \"Michelle\" is quite playful, capturing the romantic love he felt for his girlfriend, he adds, and \"Madison\" is a tribute to a beautiful Christmas holiday spent near Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nDistributed in the United States by Naxos, the album is a Hybrid Super Audio CD (SACD), presenting 15 tracks in spectacular Stereo and 5.1 Surround Sound; of course, it also plays as a normal CD. Of the high-tech recording process, 2L founder Morten Lindberg says, \"Recording music is an art of illusion. As recording engineers we need to do exactly the same as any good musician; interpret the music and the composer's intentions and adapt to the media where we perform.\"\n\nSuzanne Doucet of Only New Age Music, Inc. predicted, \"Ola's beautiful music will be embraced by a variety of audiences, and especially those who enjoyed George Winston in the early days of Windham Hill.\"\n\nUpon early review, Capt. Christopher of WTUL Radio noted \"Pianist Ola Gjeilo connects with listeners at many levels...all of them at the peak of perfection. His sensitive and tender keyboard stylings are the ideal accompaniment for an evening of romance, relaxation or fine dining...\"\n\nGjeilo is excited by the prospect of playing to small audiences in his beloved new home, New York City. Performances are announced [...]. \"I love New York with all my heart. It's almost like a person to me, it has a very strong identity and soul,\" says Gjeilo.","summary":"Stone Rose...by Any Other Name?

I will attach a photo of a first year bloom picture taken today 8\/2\/2016 from seeds sown indoors the 3rd week of may and planted outdoors the second week in June.  I do not top first year and i have several over 6 feet tall 1 plant is 7.

And for goodness sake on the bad reviews, these seeds are so easy. Here is a cheap way. If your water is bad, buy some, tiny seedlings don't like bad water. Buy a window greenhouse(brand who cares) expand the pellets as directed and lightly break up surface of peat with tooth pick, drop 5 seeds on top of each peat pellet spray with fine mist of good water. put lid on greenhouse, place under at least a 100watt comparable cfl or any florescent grow light. keep the temp btwn 70-80F (trust me ive gone hotter and things are ok, but keep it around 75) . leave the light on 24\/7 and in 7-10 days ull see tiny seedlings sometimes they sprout faster sometimes slower. when you can easily see leaves remove humidity dome and keep peat moist, if it dries out you're done. Or better yet cut holes in humidity dome to allow a balance of humidity and ventilation. once they reach about an inch tall they should have several sets of leaves. trim the peat pellet down to 1-3 seedlings and from there its real easy. The apex bloom on this branch is 13 inches long and still not fully opened. This plant was grown from these seeds this spring, and i have plenty of pictures.","summary":"Awesome germination ratio!...

What they do not tell you are small things that anyone who has built a metal shed before will know.  You'll want plenty of silicon sealant (the tube stuff you squueze out with the gun attachment).  We built the shed and sealed mostly as we went along but still need to do the roof venting area in a few spots.  Some of the venting is deliberate so as to keep the unit cool on a hot day but there were a few spots where rain may enter if not closed off a little bit more.\n\nIf you want an inexpensive yet nice looking small shed, this one is a winner.  Using a handyman (who had never built this brand metal shed before) and us to hand him tools or hold parts as directed, we finished in about 5 hours.  We had a cordless drill that also does the screws and that was a major timesaver as there are a lot of them as you can guess.  Our handyman said that now that he has done one unit of this manufacturer, it would take him about 3.5 hours to do another of the same class if he had owners who are able to hold parts in place and are tool savvy DIY types just unfamiliar with this particular project.  He said add 1 hour if he had to do it alone and add 2 hours if the owners were not experienced and got underfoot while 'trying to help' (grin).\n\nWhat you will also want is a ramp if you intend to roll a lawnmower up into it as it will sit about 4.5 inches up if you use the proper flooring kit.  You can get them pre-made or if handy, I knocked one together with spare wood in about 45 mins.","summary":"A 5 within it's class","unixReviewTime":1364083200,"style":null,"image":null}

Adams","reviewText":"Got the tank two days ago, opened the box, and saw a sturdy metal tank--like old school tanks.  I thought, WOW!, this is great.  BUT then I saw the CHEAP, FLIMSY, WOBBLY, PATHETIC 2.5 inch PLASTIC pump and reality set in.  The pump is as cheap and junky as anything I have ever seen.  I gave this TWO STARS for the tank, but the pump gets ZERO STARS.  I use pumps extensively and hate the plastic pumps in the Home Depot plastic pumps in their sprayers.  But this pump makes them look like winners.  Words fail me in describing how disappointing the cheap POS is.  When you try to pump, the shaft bends, flexes, deflects to the sides and only shoots a tiny bit of air into the tank with each pump.  Did I say JUNK?  If you are going to build a sturdy metal tank, why would you put such a worthless plastic pump in it?  Remember when the pumps were metal and you could replace the rubber grommet on the end of the pump?  That wouldn't have cost them much more and face it, we would pay another $5 to get a metal pump.  I know I am venting to the choir but why does cheap always win out?  The sprayer wand isn't much good either.  The long metal part of the wand comes loose from the metal nozzle near the handle unless you really crank it down.  I usually trust Stanley when I buy tools but from now on, I will check it out first.  Thing is, I know the pump is going to break.  It isn't \"if\" it is \"how soon.\"  I am thinking about ordering a new one now for when it does break.  Stanley, you can do better.\n\nTHREE USES LATER: After using the sprayer three times this is what I have found.  The wand attaches to the spraying handle by screwing the wand onto a PLASTIC nut.  As other users have noted, no matter how careful you are, the wand loosens and when you screw it back on, it cross threads and won't stay on. IT should have been made with brass. The wand wobbles on the spray handle and sooner or later falls off.\nALSO: The brass spray tip has no way to lock it down so it can move from fine spray to single stream by itself.  It should have been made with a lock nut to hold it in one position.  It is only a matter of time until the shoddy plastic pump breaks off. Stay tuned.\n\nFinal solution.  Sent the sprayer back today.  The wand wouldn't stay attached to the sprayer trigger handle any more.  As talked about by several reviewers even though it is a brass wand, the other parts it ATTACHES TO are PLASTIC and not even good plastic.  Since I had read about the cheap plastic parts the wand fastened to I was exceedingly careful and it stripped anyway.  If they wanted to do this sprayer right, they would make the attachment points brass and that includes the spray nozzle which is brass but attaches to cheap plastic.  I will search for some other type of metal spray tank with a good sprayer but don't hold your breath.

The clock has big bright white letters and numbers against a black background that are large enough for a visually impaired person to read, and they clearly spell out the day of the week, time of day, month, day, and year so a person with memory issues can see them and get their sense of bearing.\n\nMy mom suffered both visual impairment as well as memory issues before she passed away, and not knowing what day of the week it was or the time of day frustrated her to no end. It also made her more anxious and added to her sense of loss of control. If we would have had this clock we could have placed it on her dresser or hung it on the wall by her door so she could see it and it would have helped given her back that one aspect of control at least.\n\nThis clock comes in a plain white box that doesn't say anything about memory loss or visual aid on it, but it really is perfect for both of those applications, and it's easy to set up. The instructions are well written, understandable, and easy to follow, and the clock is easy to program in mere moments. It comes with a USB power cord and adaptor, so it does need to be plugged in to operate, but it has an internal battery that maintains the time, date, and other settings in case there's a power outage.\n\nIt can be programed to display the days in English, Spanish, French, Welsh, Danish, or German, the date in US or European mode, and with a simple push of a button it can be switched to display a message such as \"This is Monday Morning\" etc...  The lettering is crisp, bright, and large enough to read with the letters of the week being about 1\" tall, the numbers for time being 1.5\" high, and the date being about 1\/2\" in size.  The clock has been keeping excellent time, and the display even has an auto-dimming feature that dims the letters each evening around 7p.m. and then brightens them again at about 7a.m.\n\nIt's a cool looking clock that looks good wherever you put it. It would look good in an office, or be used to help kids learn how to tell time. More importantly though, this digital clock is a terrific assistive device for the visually impaired, the psychologically disoriented, and those suffering from cognitive issues secondary to stroke, traumatic brain injury, NPH, Alzheimer's, or age related impairment.","summary":"Excellent assistive device for the visually impaired or elderly","unixReviewTime":1465430400,"style":{"Color:":" White"},"image":null}

Even the trees used to the weather sometimes go into shock and loose a few leaves. The cost of water is high around here. In Summer months my water bill is usually three times as much as in winter and spring. To save you have to water your landscape wisely. Years back while driving I saw that the Parks Department of the city uses similar bags to water the newly planted trees. I know  now why they use this type of bags. First they are easy to use and to fill with water, you walk away and the water slowly drips around the root area of the tree. The water slowly penetrates the soil and no water is wasted to runoff. The bag is made of a strong rip proof material that can hold up to 20 gallons of water. The instructions included are easy to understand and follow. I thing I am going to buy a few more of these because they put the water where the trees needs  it the most.","summary":"Waters where the trees needs it the most!","unixReviewTime":1443744000,"style":{"Size:":" HG2321"},"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51+vL4PhSJL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51rUqqz1mCL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51hiNXvaoEL._SY88.jpg"]}

The grid develops nasty voltage that will feel like a gorilla tried to jerk your arm off it touched!\n\nSo when you let the button go, the resistors are designed to drain the voltage quickly so you don't inadvertently touch the screen and get zapped after the button is already released...... problem is.... this resistance drain does not start when button is released but is actually wired so its connected all the time.\nSo as long as the button is pressed, the resistor is attempting to drain the voltage from the screen but its being replenished by the battery till released..... moral of the story.......\n\nIf you want your zapper to last, DON'T KEEP THE BUTTON PRESSED FOR EXTENDED PERIODS! Don't walk around the house in hunt mode with the button pressed the whole time.....\n\nI simply use the trigger like a gun and don't press it till I'm actually swiping at the fly then I release immediately. Not only does this preserve battery, it prevents internals from overheating and gives a fresh zap from the battery that's at peak voltage.\n\nI've used mine for years now... occasionally I lightly steel wool the metal grids to keep pristine clean for max zapping but otherwise its a great tool.\nIf you get it wet, sling out the water and don't use it till the next day or you \"will\" short it out.\n\nIf a fly is on a surface, don't slam the swatter down on the surface like a conventional swatter or it won't last long, instead swipe \"over\" the fly a couple of inches as you know the fly will see you coming and attempt to escape then it will be in your path and \"zap!\"\n\nWithout some practice, a conventional swatter you slam down is more effective, but with a little practice you'll be able to nab them in flight as well as on surfaces.\nIts quite entertaining in a morbid sort of way to see them vaporize and be sentenced to a fiery death for being such a pest that they are...\n\nI also wanted to mention, this has \"C\" cell batteries vs the more common AA batteries with most other zappers..... much more amperage to deliver the higher punch and keep it coming without a battery voltage drop!\n\nAnother note, zappers with straight wire grids like this one work better than the criss-cross type..... this will come in contact with the bug much better for a clean zap. The wires are alternately charged positive and negative and when the bug bridges the connection he's toast. The criss-cross type is not so effective so this is a better design.","summary":"Swatter tips....","unixReviewTime":1481673600,"style":null,"image":null}

I have nearly 1\/2 acre of lumpy, swampy, \"lawn\" to mow in the deep South where the jungle (cane, kudzu, ivy, etc.) is constantly trying to take over. I affectionately call it my \"mower-chopper-shredder\" as it is the toughest little lawnmower I have ever had. I needed a mower light enough for a female senior citizen to handle.  This is it!  My grown son moved away and the gas propelled mowers (all 6) needed more muscle and know-how than I had.  The self propelled ones were too heavy to turn or manage on a slope.  I hope they found good homes after I put them on the curb.  This B&D lawnmower crunches tree roots, pine cones, cane shoots, vines of every description, and does a beautiful job on the lawn where it exists.  It is so light and maneuverable I can do the whole job myself.  Handling the cord is just a matter of know-how.  Even 100+ feet of extension cord adds little to the chore. I purchased a spare blade to put on, but haven't needed it yet.  Beyond that there is NO MAINTENANCE. It is still working perfectly, just waiting for the 2012 season, which will be long and hot and challenging.  This mower gets my highest recommendation.

They are heavily built, and feel very solid, but they fail way too often.  The reason I keep buying them is they are the only spray head that will deliver the water flow that I need with my hose setup.  I tapped in to the same water source that feeds my in-ground sprinkler system.  This tap is BEFORE the 75 PSI regulator that controls pressure to the house.  This makes a big difference in having a garden hose and sprayer that will actually get some work done.\n\nI have 3\/4 inch copper pipe that enters the house from the city.  I think pressure is 120 or 130 PSI.  From the 3\/4 inch feeder I tapped in with 1\" pipe, and use nothing but 1 inch pipe, with one inch fittings, including a 1 inch shut-off valve.  I did this since many of the 3\/4 valves actually do not have a full 3\/4 inch flow, so you never get the full use of the 3\/4\" pipe.  That is why I went with 1 Inch.  Then I use a very heavy 3\/4 inch garden hose, and then the Nelson Spray head.  This is the only head that will handle the water flow, and it works like a champ.  The issue is the quality.  When it works, it works well, but I have had 3 failures in about 3 years, all of them different type of failures, including leaking, handle breaking and then the last one just fell apart all of a sudden.  Weird.\n\nI would change brands, but this is the only one that actually works, and has about at 60 foot throw, with lots of water.\n\nI feel bad giving it 2 stars, since I like the way it works.

The reviews on these anchor staples indicated that they might be what I was really looking for, so I took the plunge and ordered a pack to use with a commercial weed block\/ground cover around our home in Southwest Florida.  Good decision on my part!\n\nFirst off, these are a much heavier (11) gauge, the points are sharp enough to pierce commercial ground cloth, and they are long enough to anchor the weed barrier to the ground.  A smart and well-executed design.  Prior to using these, I made my own anchors by cutting pieces of old wire hangers into an \"L\" shape and pushed those through the fabric.  The anchor staples I just bought are far superior to my homemade product and are a good deal as far as price.\n\nIn order to get the best life and use out of your ground cloth, consider the following tips.  First off, make sure to NOT pull the ground cloth tight before anchoring it down.  Chances are that you are going to have to walk on it while doing future maintenance and leaving it loose will give your ground cloth flexibility to move and lessen your chances of tearing it.  This is especially true if you end up using landscape stones and step on them.  I also use a heavy duty stapler to fasten the ground cloth to the vertical sides of any wood timbers I might use for framing.  Just remember to keep the cloth somewhat loose.  This will keep weeds from sprouting up between the cloth and the wood.\n\nThe other thing I try to do is to not only minimize the number of staples I use, but to also fold a piece of the cloth over the staples before covering it with the stones or mulch.  ANY hole in your landscape cloth can let in seeds the either float in or are dropped by birds or other animals, so minimizing the points of intrusion will work in your favor.  If you can, or as much as you can, avoid walking on your landscaped areas to minimize tearing.  .","summary":"Robust, Strong, And Comfortably Long","unixReviewTime":1465430400,"style":null,"image":null}

They seem so have a nice durable feel and weight to them that leaves me feeling good about using them.  I used this on an existing Cal-grill brand insert and have been very happy with it.  The fabric has a nice weight to it and the cover itself has enough adjustment in it to make the fit just right around my grill.  Seems to stand up well to the wind and certainly keeps the grill nice and clean\/dry in it's location.\n\nWill certainly continue to use Classic Accessory covers when I have any needs.

In my post-surgical state I have trouble bending and lifting heavy objects. But I can work the Toro Power Shovel! I bought it with low expectation, thinking that either it will not work well or that I will have trouble with it due to my current physical limitation. Surprisingly, neither concern materialized. Toro easily chopped through 10 inch snow bank left from 18 inches that fell a few days ago, and I was able to push it through the snow as well as move it up and down the stairs to the house. In some areas I was able to push it one handed which was an easier position on my back, and sometimes I needed the second hand to get through a tougher spot. The handle is adjustable so with the highest position I don't have to bend too much.\n\nWet snow update:\nI am updating this review after the first wet snow. Toro power shovel handled it well! It was a little harder to push, but I found that I could brace the handle on my thigh and that allowed me to push with my leg rather than my injured back. Then it was easy!\n\nThe hardest thing to deal was not the show shovel itself, but the 100 feet of electric cord, which was heavy, unwieldy and became almost unmanageable to coil back, especially when it became cold and covered with snow. The electric caddy was not much help, it was hard to control. Putting back the cord tired me out more than shoveling itself.\n\nI found that the Toro power shovel was stable without having to lean it against a wall when I put it a big plastic storage bin (see picture). This way when I bring the shovel in and the snow melts I will not have a puddle on the floor. The caddy with the electrical cord fit nicely on top of the shovel in the bucket (see picture).\n\nThis product is build for a right-handed person.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI found a solution for an electric cord winding - it is called Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Green-Leaf-WW-1-Wonder-Winder-Hand-Crank-Extension-Cord-Winder\/dp\/B00005A1K1\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank Extension Cord Winder<\/a>\n\nAli Julia review","summary":"Easy to operate even with a back problem","unixReviewTime":1295136000,"style":null,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51Ihw5xR8GL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51Rdt4aH3ML._SY88.jpg"]}

Instead of folding the front piece and securing it at the front of the canopy as per instructions, after I unzip the sides I pull the entire front piece over the top of the canopy.  I then bring the front edge of each side up to the top and clip each to the front piece--thus allowing free air circulation from each side and the front is completely open.  I position the side pieces to shade the swing from direct sun, so in the a.m. the side facing East is more shaded and in the p.m. the side facing West is more shaded with the cover.  The cover is about 6\" too wide and 6\" too long for my swing, but this isn't really a problem for me.  I use clips to raise the bottom edge off the ground or pavement.  It is well worth the money and I would recommend it to anyone with a swing--there are cheaper covers available, but in the long-run this is the best value for the money.  The cover makes it possible to use my swing year round and regardless of the weather---and keeps my cushions dry!  There is a ventilation mesh to allow for air circulation to prevent mold and mildew, but it is too low for me to use in this manner. I am able to insure air circulation inside the cover since the bottom is open to the pavement and I usually have the cover open each day unless it is raining hard.  This cover stops having to dry off water-resistent cushions, table top, etc.","summary":"Best idea since sliced bread for your swing","unixReviewTime":1339545600,"style":{"Size:":" 86W x 50D x 70H","Color:":" Green Polyester"},"image":null}

All of the pieces go \"right side outward facing\" EXCEPT FOR THE BOTTOM, which has the finished side facing the INSIDE of the box. This will make things much easier for your assembly.\n2. If you are having problems getting the pieces together, LOOK AGAIN at the instructions, I found it was easy to get mixed up. Once I got them in the right places and facing in the right direction, it snapped together pretty seamlessly and easily, except for the top.\n3. For the top, you have to align the three \"hinge\" sections and then sitting on the top may help to seat at least some of them. Once you get 1-2 of them seated, the rest will pop together more easily, at least that was my experience. I sat on the two end hinge parts and they snapped right in. I sat on the middle one and it did nothing. I got up, pushed down on the middle hinge, and it popped right into place.\n4. Remember that the right side has the little string of plastic that will connect to the right side of the top, this helps to keep the sides in the correct place when assembling.\n5. I recommend that when you get done, check the corner seams on the inside to see if any of them need another thump\/bump to get them into place. A rubber mallet came in handy for this when I finished my assembly.\n\nAll in all, I'd hate to bet my life on it, however the seat feels pretty firm.

I'm going to tell you what I don't like first, because there's just a couple things I don't like.  Those things might be deal-breakers for some people.  The electronics on this smoker are sketchy, meaning the control panel would sometimes just blink out when I was adjusting the temperature or time settings.  I played with the controls for a while, plugged and unplugged the smoker, and then it started working.  The remote control sometimes turned the unit off when I pushed a button, too.  I sat with the smoker for about 3 of 4 hours while smoking a beef brisket, and the smoker controls never missed a beat thereafter.  The next thing I don't like is having to put pellets (preferred) or chips into the smoker tube every 45 minutes to an hour.  That's ridiculous.  I have a great solution -- use at your own risk -- to defeat this problem.  More on that later.  I also wish the temperature setting would go up to 300 deg F instead of 275 deg F.  The last thing is getting a smoker with glass in front is a waste of time and money and just another thing to worry about if the seal went bad or the glass got broken, in my opinion, of course.  The glass smokes and smudges up so badly so quickly that I wish I had just gotten a 40 inch smoker with no window.  Yes, I know I can clean the glass every time with some white vinegar.  Ok, now to the good.  I love the fact that this unit can be used with a cold smoker.  It has made some fantastic smoked cheese for me in about 2 hours.  I like the fact that the thermostat kicks the unit's heating element back on when the temperature falls 2-3 degrees below the target temperature.  I like all the drip pans and trays.  I like the built in meat probe, altho I bought a separate aftermarket wireless meat probe just to keep the Masterbuilt probe honest.  There is about 9 deg F difference between the 2 probes so far.  I like the fact that this unit is electric, so I don't have to worry (I hope) about it not continuing to heat (compared to running out of propane), unless the power goes out for some reason.  It is rated at 10A @ 120VAC, so be prepared to use some juice while this unit is heating up.  The cold smoke is rated at 1.5A @ 120VAC, as a side note, but you should not be running them both together at the same time UNLESS you want to try something I have done *at your own risk*:  I bought a 6 inch and a 12 inch smoking cube.  I don't care what brand you buy.  I bought what was cheapest while still earning good reviews.  So I don't have to babysit this smoker every 45 minutes to an hour and add pellets, I light up the 6 inch cube for 2 hours smoke, or I light up the 12 inch cube for about 4 hours smoke.  They work very well, and they are pretty consistent for the 2 and 4 hours durations.  I am even thinking about buying a couple more tubes to have them loaded up and ready to light for longer smoking projects.  The only problem I can see with using the cubes is I have to open the door to replace the cubes, and that lets some of the heat and smoke out, but these cubes produce their own heat (helps with the maintaining of internal temp) and smoke so quickly that it really doesn't matter.  The other thing I have done is to shoot smoke in from the cold smoker into the main body of the smoker and not use the chip\/pellet tube at all.  The heating element in the smoker itself will heat up the insides, and the cold smoker outside produces the smoke up to about 6 hours has been my experience so far.  Again, do so at your own risk.  I did not have good results using the smoker outside in the wind in cold weather.  Again, do this at your own risk:  I put my smoker right inside the door of the garage so it's protected from the wind on 3 sides (I have machine shed type doors that slide side to side, not up and down), and I opened the door a bit to let the smoke out and some cold air in.  That helps quite a bit.  If I had to do it all over again, I would not buy the 40 incher with the glass front.  I would get the 40 inch with the simplest and most reliable controls as well.  I would also make sure the smoker allows for the addition of the cold smoker.  This is a must, in my opinion.  The cold smoker is soooo great for smoking cheese.","summary":"A pretty good unit, but spend less money and buy a Masterbuilt 40 inch without the glass front - 4 stars","unixReviewTime":1512604800,"style":{"Size:":" 40 Inch","Color:":" Stainless","Style:":" Top Controller\/Window"},"image":null}

The material fed in has to be dry or the outlet chute clogs.  This may be a safety feature, but is also a design flaw.  The chute makes a right angle bend from the shredder body and the output jams up in it.  I have found that the easiest way to grind almost anything is by feeding it into the \"branches\" port at the back, which seems to give it a better angle into the blades.  I use a 1\/4\" diameter wooden dowel to push the weeds and twigs into the port, and also to clean out the outlet chute.  Cleaning the chute constantly keeps the shredder from jamming.  Once it jams it has to be disassembled, which is a frustrating and time consuming process.\n\nThe best thing about the shredder is that it is electric but the downside to that is the relative lack of power and capacity.","summary":"fine for very lightweight duty","unixReviewTime":1231891200,"style":null,"image":null}

I've also used it in my goldfish pond (which developed a bad case of hair algae), and while I miss seeing the fish swimming, I'm hoping that blocking the sun will help rid the pond of the algae.  Not to mention the fish seem to appreciate the shade from the Florida sun.  Again, it takes the least little amount to get the \"mirrored\" effect, so have plenty left over when this fades.

I hesitated before buying this - would I really use it? Did I really need it? I finally decided that no matter what, I needed a new pole saw. 21 feet was a no brainer, I have a lot of oaks that have lots of little dead branches. I have pines that need limbing up and in the past, I used a ladder strapped to the tree.\n\nNo more ladders. Trimming has become fun! I can't say enough good about this saw. I'm rating this on the merits for a homeowner - it's certainly occcasional use compared to any tree professional. But at this it excels. I can use the sickle end to pull dead branches off. The cutting is easy - gravity helps make the downward cut. The length is superb. And to me, the quality shows.\n\nThere's no question about it - you have to know how to use it. A hard hat is a must if you are working things above you. Positioning yourself is really important as well as planning for the branch's landing zone. Anticipating what's going to happen when the saw makes it through the branch is the most important thing in terms of handling it and keeping it from being damaged. And at 21 foot extension, it's definitely a workout!\n\nGiven all of the above, I can't say enough good about this saw. Used correctly and carefully it's a real workhorse. It's enabled trimming that I never thought I would be able to do without someone climbing the trees. The downside is that I cut so much wood down that hauling it afterwards is the real chore. That's not a bad thing - the trees have never looked better around here!\n\nI like the cover for the blade. I like the locking mechanisms. I like the oval shape. I like the wrapped handle. And lastly, I love the blade itself. It's just amazing compared to the consumer pole saws that I've owned and used. I like the blade so much that I got a Silky hand saw to carry too and it's similarly amazing. Great stuff.","summary":"Amazing pole saw","unixReviewTime":1437264000,"style":null,"image":null}

Good Value on Amazon. 18v might seem puny in this new wave of 36-40v cordless technology. This unit has good balance with an 18\" scicle bar. Plenty of power in the 1.3 AH battery to run the unit for about 20 min. I have used it extensively on brush. If the stem, ca. 1\/2\" will fit in the cutter guards, it will cut with a snap. General hedge trimming is an ease and pleasure with this unit. 20-30 min of cutting is all you want to do. Definitely a homeowners tool. Battery takes 3+ hours to charge, with full charge indicator light. By then you will probably want to do something else, anyway. Front handle-grip is the safety trigger switch. When squeezed with trigger pulled on rear handle, the trimmer actuates. Let off trigger or handle-switch and the unit shuts down. Scicle bar can be rotated 45, 90, 180 degrees. Light weight and low vibration for hand fatigue. I would have given it 5 stars; but the unavailability of extra batteries is a negative for me. However, the Li-ion slide-in battery by Black & Decker has the same 3 pin configuration on the battery and tool. Looks like B&D may be the mfg. There is a plastic tab on the B&D that you will have to cut off to use on the charger and tool. And, the pins are barely misaligned, so you will need to carefully make some pin adjustments and shave\/trim some plastic around the pins. I did it; works fine. A very nice product and well-designed. Someone will produce an after-market battery soon. If your tired of 2-cycle woes on infrequently used equipment, electric\/cordless is the way to go.  And, don't think the 18v systems are puny. Plenty of power and reasonable price. I recommend this mfg, and unit. I don't think you'll be disappointed.","summary":"MLG 18v hedge trimmer","unixReviewTime":1435276800,"style":null,"image":null}

I thought I'd check the temperature of my walls, floors, ceiling and a few hot water pipes, watch a few pans heat up, and then put it in a drawer.\n\nI've now found the product to be indispensable and use it at least once a day.  I have a gas range.  I can check a pan that is heating and get just the right temperature for fried eggs (300 degrees or so) or pancakes (375 degrees.)  I'm no sure how would cook these items without it.  I heat  the cooking scrambled eggs to about 140 degrees at a high gas setting while stirring, and then cut the fire back to minimal to finish the eggs.\n\nI built a new house in the past few years.  I've used the product to determine how well it is insulated and to find air leaks.  Fortunately I've found I don't have any problems.  I took the device to a friends house which is older and we found all sorts of issues including an uninsulated ceiling in one area.\n\nTo use the device one holds the trigger in.  There is a laser to help with selecting the target point.  When held an foot away from the target the temperature is sensed from a circle with a diameter of one inch.  The holding the device closer or further away changes the diameter of the sensing zone.  As long as the trigger is held the device continues to measure the temperature, even if it changes.  When the trigger is released the last temperature read is held until the device automatically turns off which is in a minute or so.  This operation is totally intuitive.\n\nI thought of writing this review because I just changed the batteries in the device (September 2013).  I've owned it since February, 2012.  It took a minute tops, to change the two AAA batteries.  I consider this to be excellent battery life given how much I use the device.\n\nAlong with the Thermapen thermometer for measuring interior temperatures of food, this product is a must-have for cooking.  The Kintrex thermometer also has other valuable uses around the house.","summary":"\"I've become accustomed to her face...,\" an indispensable product","unixReviewTime":1379808000,"style":null,"image":null}

{"overall":5,"vote":"2","verified":true,"reviewTime":"07 5, 2015","reviewerID":"A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","asin":"B000XTMG8W","reviewerName":"Timbo Slims","reviewText":"For the longest time, I had three brass hose nozzles.  One in my backyard, one in my front yard, and a floater that went camping, in the RV, etc.  One of those nozzles I purchased from Lee Valley (which I will call #1 for this review), and it was all brass, and I had it for at least 10 years.  The second, or #2, I am not sure where I bought it, and had it for at least 15 years - I am thinking Home Depot.  The third one (#3) was a semi-recent purchase from Home Depot (5 or so years old?) and it was brass with that blasted plastic \/ rubber coating over the nozzle.\n\nRecently, I noticed that the Lee Valley nozzle (#1) and the HD nozzle (#3) were leaking \/ dripping no matter how much I tried to torque them down.  I even tried new O-Rings to no avail... they would leak no matter what.  However, the oldest nozzle (#2) still worked flawlessly, and did not leak or drip.  Plus, the #2 nozzle had the best \/ tightest spray pattern on the coarsest setting, and moreover, when turning the nozzle and cycling through the different flows, it transitioned smoothly from start to finish, and finished up with a fine mist and wide spray pattern.  The other nozzles were not as tight a pattern, and were not as smooth on adjustment.  It should be noted that the nozzle that worked the best was also the nozzle I used the most, and was 15 years old.\n\nSo, since my other two nozzles were drippy (which drove me nuts), it was time to replace them.  So I went to Home Depot.... well, some of you know what happened next, a lot has changed over the years.  NO ALL BRASS NOZZLES.  Same thing at Lowes.  Of course Amazon had brass nozzles, and a selection no less!!  Then, my goal was to find the one that has worked so well over the years - IF it was still available.  The problem this nozzle I had for 15 years had NO markings on it - no country of manufacture (though I assumed US), no product branding... nothing.  Just a finely crafted, well functioning nozzle with no identifying marks.\n\nWhen I was not sure I would find it, I originally got \"sucked in\" by the \"Worlds Best\" brass nozzle, which is VERY similar to the Dramm nozzle also sold here on Amazon.  So I bought the Dramm.  Bottom line - fine nozzle - BUT it was too rough a pattern (not tight on the full stream spray), and did not transition well through the spray pattern.  The difference was the top was very wide, and the inside part of the nozzle was a markedly larger diameter than the one I had for the last 15 years... I just did not prefer the way it performed.\n\nSo I then tried harder to find the same one I had that worked so well - the one we call #2 - by looking at the pictures here on Amazon closely.  I found two nozzles here on Amazon that looked like the nozzle - one was a nozzle from Backyard Pros and this Gilmour nozzle.  So I bought the one from Backyard Pros hoping it was similar.  The biggest difference I saw in the Amazon pics was the Backyard Pros nozzle has \"Made in USA\" printed on the nozzle.  Bottom line - when the nozzle came in, it did not take long to discover it was not as refined or well functioning than the brass nozzle I had all these years.\n\nFINALLY, I purchased this Gilmour nozzle.  And you guessed it - other than a couple of minor differences, it was identical to the nozzle I had all these years.  The Gilmour nozzle still has no identifying marks just like the one I own, no country of manufacture, no branding, etc.  (Even though the pic here on Amazon appears to have stamped printing on the base of the nozzle, the one I received does not have any markings).  The real test - I took the new Gilmour nozzle outside, hooked it up and tried it out - and it performed as well, if not better than the one I own.  FOUND IT!!!\n\nI plan on purchasing another.  Am I picky and \/ or a little particular about my hose nozzle?  Maybe.  But I know I want solid brass, and after having one that has performed so well, lets just say I learned the difference, and got spoiled by what I perceived as better \/ cleaner performance.  NOTE the Gilmour nozzle is not as fat as other brass nozzles, and this means it probably does not have the throughput or gallons per minute rating.  BUT, it has a nice tight stream, and transitions through the spray pattern smoothly and cleanly.  It also sprays much further as a result if that matters. The other nozzles may put out more water, but I do not prefer them due to their performance.  The fatter nozzles like the Dramm, Worlds Best, etc have a sloppy full stream, and the spray pattern does not transition smoothly in volume, and at some point just instantly stops....\n\nI would recommend the Gilmour nozzle to anyone who would ask....\n\nThanks for reading.","summary":"I looked long and hard to find the brass hose nozzle like I bought years ago- and this is \"The One\"","unixReviewTime":1436054400,"style":{"Item Package Quantity:":" 1","Package Quantity:":" 1"},"image":null}

Each worked in its own way, from the MTD two-stage to my personal favorite, the Craftsman one-stage.\n\nMany people see one-stage snow throwers as junk, and I'll agree they have their limitations in heavy or wet snow. But if you get out there right when the snow falls and clear it before it hits ten inches, you'll have a fine time with this little wonder.\n\nIt does as good a job at snow removal as my Craftsman single did--the two-stage may be a bit more versatile but it's like handling a rototiller and you have to have a place to store it. This baby hangs on a pair of wall hooks in the garage, with the cord hanging next to it.\n\nI was amazed at how well this little \"off brand\" thrower does its work. I got it to test the proposition that 99% of snow removal can be done with a little tool like this. But it bore me out last year. Neighbor has an Ariens that cost him almost $1400. When he saw my little blower he offered to clear my driveway for me.\n\nAfter clearing my (two-car with turnout space) driveway and hanging up the machine and cord back in the garage, I looked next door. He was still trying to get the beast started.\n\nUPDATE MARCH 2010:\n\nWell, I had almost three seasons with Snow Joe, but he couldn't handle the double whammy snowstorms of February--gave up the ghost. So I bought the Toro version of the same thing. It handles very similarly to the Snow Joe, but the impeller and chute design is better. I wish the chute crank were easier to reach (liked that about the SJ) but the Toro gets more snow faster than the SJ.\n\nI was very close to buying one of Toro's gas Power Curve models, but went with another electric. When the second snowstorm hit, this Toro went through it like butter. I made sure to get out there and clear the first batch before it hit ten inches. Second batch was actually deeper at probably about ten inches, and it was just as easy. The Toro took full-width bites out of the first pass. The deeper pass required me to bump it out 4 inches or so to account for the higher snow volume.\n\nBut it chewed through it like a champ. I continue to recommend electric snowblowers to homeowners who don't face a huge amount of snow in the winter and don't have more than a hundred feet between their outlet and the street. My 100-foot cord hits the end just as I get to the street. If my driveway were a foot longer I'd have to go with a longer cord.\n\nBut I am switching my recommendation from Snow Joe to Toro. The Toro throws better, stays clearer, is better put together, and is quieter than the Snow Joe, especially under load.\n\nSpend the extra and get the Toro. You won't be sorry.","summary":"Switched to electric. UPDATE 3\/2010","unixReviewTime":1196553600,"style":null,"image":null}

I swear I spent more time applying band aids and trying to get the line to feed properly than I did actually weed eating.\n\nNot only is it poorly designed from a safety standpoint but even when it feeds line properly (infrequently) it uses the required .80 line like crazy.  Sure, it has plenty of power and can cut through nearly anything, but the strong motor doesn't make up for the poor design and safety deficiencies.  The best thing I can say about the \"grass hog\" is that as a string trimmer it's decent but extremely hard to control- it kept digging in and wanting to cut way more than I needed, resulting in mangled borders and lawn edges.  As an edger it's flat out terrible and leaves pieces of line all over my yard and street.\n\nPoorly designed and borderline dangerous, especially for the more diminutive gardeners amongst us.

There are many cheap and flimsy feeders on the market, but not this one.  The feeder is HUGE compared to standard feeders, which is great for folks who do not want to fill feeders all the time.  The acrylic dome is thick and will probably last many years.\n\nWe have seasonal problems with larger birds, especially Starlings, cleaning out our feeders to the dismay of smaller birds.  The best part about this feeder is Starlings don't like it and won't use it much, which is great!  The Starlings and other bigger birds find the feeding pegs and the large dome a bit too difficult to navigate.  Woodpeckers of all sizes love the feeder because they hang upside down instead of landing on the pegs.  There are 6 silos within the feeder, so you can do taste tests with different types of foods.  For example, I filled one silo with suet balls and was shocked to see that feeding hole being frequented by titmice.  Who knew?  You can have fun with the freedom that multiple silos provide, but I ended up filling the feeder with one kind of food.\n\nIn all, I was a little shocked by how expensive this feeder is to the point where I probably wouldnt have purchased it without having used one first.  Now that Ive had it for a month, I am convinced I would buy it because you get what you pay for with bird feeders.  Ive purchased dozens of cheap feeders of the years and they always break after a season or two.  This feeder is a tank and will probably be around longer than me.

As empty-nesters, we are finding our large Weber Genesis Grill is larger than we need.  The Cadac 98700-33-01 Stratos 3-Burner Stainless Steel 39,000 BTU Gas Grill is the ideal size for small families or those who may, like us, be empty-nesters.\n\nASSEMBLY:  A pictorial assembly guide is included in the box; there are no instructions in writing.  Assembly is not difficult and requires only a Phillips screwdriver.  Some screws are pre-positioned; you may need to remove them to complete assembly and then reposition those screws.  From the opening of the box through completed assembly, total time for having the grill up and operational was less than 90 minutes.\n\nAPPEARANCE and SIZE:  The Cadac Stratos is an attractive grill.  The powdered black-painted frame and powdered gray-painted sides and doors contrast nicely with the stainless steel hood.  The hood is double-walled, but is not especially heavy.  The grilling and griddle surfaces, as well as the hanging rack, are porcelain-enameled stainless steel.\n\nThe Cadac Stratos may be a good choice for those with limited outdoor space.  When the side shelves are folded down, the grill is approximately 30  wide X 20 deep, including the knob protrusion X 41  high when the lid is closed.  When the lid is opened, the grill is approximately 51 high; when the side shelves are both extended, the width of the Cadac Stratos is about 48.  The cooking grids of the actual grilling surface measure about 15 X 15; there is a non-removable 6 X 15 griddle on the right side of the cooking area.  A porcelain-enameled hanging rack, attached to the hood provides an area of about 5 wide X 22  long on which to heat bread or rolls that are no more than 4 high.\n\nCOOKING:  The real test of a grill is its cooking capability.  Preheated for four-minutes on high with all three burners ignited, the grill reached a temperature, measured on the thermometer built into the hood, of 410 F.  Lighting only 2-burners during preheating resulted in the temperature on the Cadac Stratos reaching only 325 F.  Meats cooked in the same amount of time as they did on our Weber; lamb, steak and bone-in pork chops were done to the desired stage and, even though the lamb and pork chops were not trimmed clean of fat, there was little flare-up.  There was no burning and the meat did not stick to the grills surface.  With regard to grilling, this product is very good.  Salmon cooked on the griddle was almost perfect - the skin was crisp and the filet flakey.  We sprayed the griddle's surface with a no-stick grill spray to prevent the fish from sticking.  After cooking, the griddle cleaned up easily, requiring only a little scrubbing with a non-metal, non-abrasive scrubby.\n\nWARRANTY and COST:  Because we have always cooked on Weber grills, I decided to compare the Cadac Stratos to that companys comparably sized product.  The Weber Spirit Gas Grill is very close to the price of the Cadac Stratus - $399 vs. $379.  However, the warranty on the Weber unit is 10 years vs. a 5-year warranty on the Cadac Stratus with respect to the cook box.  The warranty on enameled parts for both is 5 years.  Stainless steel burner tubes are warranted for 10-years on Weber products, on the Cadac Stratos, 2-years. All remaining parts have a 2-year warranty on Weber products and a 1-year warranty, with the exception of plastic components, on the Cadac Stratos.  Thus, if you move your grill frequently, the plastic casters may wear out.  I recommend replacing them with more durable casters when you initially assemble the unit.  Because Cadac seems to be a new product offering in the United States, availability and cost of replacement parts in the future is unknown.\n\nBecause we use our grill twice daily, we have had to, in the past, make claims under a grill's warranty.  Based on all factors the Cadac 98700-33-01 Stratos 3-Burner Stainless Steel 39,000 BTU Gas Grill is a 4-star product.  Were the warranty periods increased to those of Weber products, the Cadac Stratos would have received 5 stars.\n\nSHIPPING and DELIVERY NOTE: UPS delivered my grill both upside down and to the wrong address.  Damage to the grill was primarily cosmetic; my spouse was able to straighten the pieces that were slightly bent.  Had it not been for the excellent packing job by Amazon  boxing the box, lots of air cushions, and lots of cardboard corners to secure the grill packaging  it is likely the grill would have been more seriously damaged.  If I had purchased this item rather than receiving it from the Vine program for review, I would have returned it.  If you purchase a grill and have it shipped to you, be sure to check the packaging and the actual grill carefully for any damage.","summary":"Excellent Choice for Small Families and Those With Limited Outdoor Space ...","unixReviewTime":1428796800,"style":{"Size:":" 39,000 BTU"},"image":null}

The second pass \"erased\" the lines of my first attempt and I can see lines just like when I mow with my Black & Decker.\n\nThis might be obvious to you, but push reel mowers only cut when going forward.  I caught myself a couple of times trying to mow backwards, it doesn't work.\n\nOn the property there are three tucked away small pieces of grass and the Fiskars dealt with those admirably, but those areas don't grow vigorously and did not require raking.\n\nWith the raking it took me 45 minutes to mow the lawn, and 15 minutes of that was raking.  When I mow the vigorous part of the lawn twice with my black and decker, I still need to rake but less, since it mulches, and I don't need to rake in between mowings, I can mow back to back.  With the Fiskers, if you don't rake up the tall grass, the level of effort is almost that same as the first pass, if not worse.  So, I raked and the second pass was a breeze.\n\nAlso, this push reel mower is so much easier to transport up and downstair when compared to a gasoline or electric mower.  There is a handle by the blades (it probably exists for the June 2012 grass catcher, I can't wait!). This handle allows  you to pick up the reel mower and balance it with the larger handle, just make sure that the blades have stopped before you pick it up.\n\nIn conclusion, if you have small patches of lawn (20' X 20') that do not grow vigorously, like under trees, or shaded by a building, or a fence, than this mower is more convenient than a gas or electric one.  If you have larger areas (50' x 50') that grow fast and thick, then you are going to rake less with a mulching mower than with the Fiskars push reel.  Also, grass does like some thatch, so raking every time is not healthy for your lawn.  I will still wheel out the mulching mower, sigh, but I would rather not have to do so.\n\nUPDATE: 4\/29\/2012 --> I mowed again after 5 days and it worked great, I did two passes, criss cross and the lines came out beautifully and I did not need to rake in between and the second pass actually mulched what was leave on my vigorously growing lawn.  I would still like the grass catcher for the perimeter.  The push mower has the tendency to throw grass to the left, so if you keep the mulch edge to your right, then less grass will fall on your mulch, if you go around left you get a lot more cut grass in your garden\/mulch area.","summary":"Bag Catcher Needed, but oh so easy","unixReviewTime":1335398400,"style":null,"image":null}

I paid the full purchase price from a large hardware store.  My review is based on spending my hard-earned money on a hedge trimmer.  Also note that I wrote a very negative reviw on the Dewalt string trimmer.  This put a wrench in my plans, as I wanted to standardize on a battery platform and I thought that the Dewalt Hedge Trimmer and the Dewalt String Trimmer would be the products that I invest in the batteries.  Though I love this hedge trimmer, I might return it because I really want a common battery platform for my power tools.\n\nIn doing my review, I am basing it on my 3 years of experience in using my Echo HC- 150 Hedge Trimmer.  My initial impression is that the Dewalt is a much better tool, and that it does deliver gas performance based on this comparison.\n\n- Power - Plenty of cutting power, it surpasses the Echo 150 that it is replacing.  It cuts thick holly branches with ease, I am able to \"scuplt\" my hedges, not just trim them.  The Echo's clutch would slip on the larger branches, the Dewalt has the power to cut them.\n\n- Build Quality - Comapred to the $289 Echo HC 150 that this replaces, I feel that the Dewalt blades are of higher quality of construction, but I do not belive that the casing is better.  Like another reveiwer reports, the screws are too simplistic and seems that it will break.\n\n- Weight - The Echo and Dewalt are comparable within an ounce of each other.  But I feel that the Dewalt, with the 4 AH battery has better balance than the Echo.  The balance places less stress on my wrist and arms.  However, compared to a Stihl 45, the dewalt is over 2 pounds heavier.  Weight is a critical feature for hedge trimmers.\n\n- Battery life - the battery last at least as long as a tank of gas on the echo.\n\nWhen comparing the Dewalt 40V Hedge Trimmer to an Echo 150 Hedge Trimmer (which is a gas model); I feel that the dewalt matches and perhaps out performs the Echo.  When compared to a gas-powered Stihl (which is also the same price as the Dewalt), the Stihl is more powerful, lighter, and better constructed.\n\nThough this is an improvement over my Echo, I think I might return it and buy the stihl.  The main reason is that I am very disappointed in the Dewalt string trimmer, and I do not want to invest in an inventory of $200 batteries for a single tool.\n\nUpdate***********\nI decided to return this hedge trimmer.  For the price, I can purchase a gas-powered hedge trimmer that is 2.6 pounds lighter and more power.  The reduced weight is a significant benefit for the gas model, because the lower weight reduces the fatique and stress on my wrist.  I am also not pleased that the Dewalt string trimmer was such a disappointment.  I do not want to invest in these expensive batteries when the product line only has one model that I like.","summary":"Dewalt 40V Hedge Trimmer delivers gas-powered performance","unixReviewTime":1434931200,"style":{"Style:":" 40V Battery"},"image":null}

They just aren't worth the money.  I did a head to head test on 20 deep root weeds and this product does a lot of damage to the ground.  Yes it will get the whole root out but only 60% of the time.  Which may work for Bryan Fantana but in my yard that means these will grow back.  The Fiskars removed the weed and its entire root nearly 85% of the time.  The biggest difference is on the 2nd attempt to remove the weed & roots the Garden Weasel really ripped up the ground making 2.5\" deep holes ripping up existing grass roots and tearing up the yard with limited results on actually removing the root left behind.  The Fiskars root remover clams around the root and removes it with accuracy and does very little damage to the surrounding grass which means you can repair the hole very easily too.  With the Weasel you have to do a good bit of work to try to replant the chunk of earth it removes and leaves a VERY noticeable mark on every root you try to pull.\n\nTop it all off with saftey.  The weasel requires you to stand on one foot and use the other to step on the tool to uproot the weed.  Which sounds easy but if you are old you may fall.  The Fiskars can be used with one hand and both feet planted firmly on the ground.  You just place it over the weed and press it into the ground using your foot if needed to really go deep then pull back.  No dangerous balancing act.  Simple and safe for older or less balanced people.\n\nTop it all of with the metal it is made with bends if you pull back on it.  Disappointed it bent on my first 8 times using it.

It fits better in my kitchen, and is simpler to operate (not as many options) for what I use it for. However, if the plants you're growing do better with less than 16 hours of light, the Ultra (or other model that's programmable) would be a better choice. Also, although the description stated that this new Sprout has LEDs - it doesn't, so these lights take more energy and will need to be replaced more often than the LEDs on the Ultra.\n\nI don't recommend the Sprout, Ultra, or any other model, for growing tomatoes to harvest. The tomatoes taste watered down - a little better than store-bought, but not even close to garden-grown. I *do* recommend that you start your tomatoes with this (much faster growth than in soil) until they start flowering and producing fruit, then transfer them to pots for ripening. I did this (two plants lived, the other didn't survive the transfer), and the tomatoes tasted amazing. So much better than when ripened in the AeroGarden. When you transfer, make sure you soak the soil with water for the first week so they'll transition to a soil-based system more easily.\n\nWhen using the AeroGarden (any model), read through the instructions. It's important to know how often to fertilize (and how much), when\/how to prune, when to raise the light, etc. If you don't read the instructions, your plants won't grow well, won't flower, and will be thin instead of robust. So read the instructions, and watch the videos at the AeroGarden website. If you don't like to read instructions, don't purchase this - you'll be wasting your time and money.\n\nI recommend the Sprout (or the Ultra if you want to \"incubate\" more plants at one time and\/or need less than 16 hours of light for what you're growing) to start your plants very quickly and get them flowering and fruiting. But I don't recommend it for harvesting tasteful fruit. Instead, transfer them to soil. You'll *love* the difference in taste.","summary":"Recommended for starting plants quickly, but not through to harvest","unixReviewTime":1446076800,"style":{"Color:":" Black"},"image":null}

I love watching them and having them around our house so I was excited to review this Acrylic Window Bird Feeder from Yellow Beaks. It brings the birds up close for you to see!\nWe get a wide variety of wildlife in our area and I always find it fascinating to observe. This bird feeder allows you to see birds close up, right in your window.\nI love that the size allows several to gather at once. Little birds just hop right inside! It is strong enough for the bigger cardinals to land on it as well. We have had some really strong storms since I hung it up and I was worried it would disappear in the high wind, but it didn't budge and the three large suction cups have kept it stuck firm to the glass!\nI like that I can provide a place for our birds to eat without serving them up as a snack for our kitties! Where I put mine, on a second story window, I don't have to worry about squirrels or other critters getting into it, but the slick angled roof would prevent them from getting into the feeder. We have had only one storm where the birdseed got wet and that was only because the rain came from an unusual direction and the strong winds were blowing the rain completely horizontal. The days that we have had normal rain, the bird house has worked great at protecting the seed and keeping it dry.\nThe bird feeder holds a good amount of seed so you don't have to constantly keep filling it and the birds have plenty to peck at. It is so funny to watch them pick and choose which things they want to eat! I use a fruit and nut blend that they seem to really like.\nThe feeder is super easy to use. It is a solid piece that doesn't need any assembly and you only have to place the suction cups. Since my window is so high off the ground, I put the suction cups into the holes on the back of the feeder and pressed them onto the glass. It has stayed solidly in place without any problem.\nI can't stop taking pictures of the birds that are visiting now! It started with one little one and now there are several that come and jockey for position. The number seems to increase every day!\nThe bird feeder is a great way for kids to safely see birds up close and learn about them. It would also bring enjoyment to an elderly or home bound person. This makes a great gift for any birdwatchers on your holiday list!.","summary":"Sit Back And Watch Birds Right In Your Window!","unixReviewTime":1438819200,"style":{"Size:":" Window bird feeder"},"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71IKzT-C5eL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71h9A30oTLL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71B4RPQbNuL._SY88.jpg"]}

It arrived. MISSING THE PROPANE REGULATOR!!! I live in an area where these aren't sold or found. Very upset with this purchase. I needed it for a 80 lbs crawfish boil party the next day. Too late to order in time for next day air again. What the %$!@ do I do now? BAYOU CLASSIC SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nJust called my friend in Wisconsin to tell him. He referred me to this product. Said a couple of guys in his area bought one in the last month for family seafood boils, canning and beer making. Incoming threads on the burner itself are defective. Sent theirs back to Amazon. The regulator won't screw in. My box was factory sealed with clear tape. I thought it was a previous return to Amazon and someone forgot to put it back in the box. \"Bayou Classic\" has NO quality control checks. Brought the unit in to my local hardware store (they deal in a lot of Coleman and numerous other grills) to fit a new regulator. Guess what? NO REGULATOR ON EARTH FITS A BAYOU CLASSIC PROPANE STOVE!\n\nI cannot tell you how angry I am. No store carries these. Not Home Depot. Not Lowes. Not Dick's Sporting Goods. Not REI. Not ACE. Not WalMart. Not Target. Not Northern Tool. Not Menards. Not Mall of America. It's all online dealers that REFUSE to ship overnight. I know none of them stock anything listed on their websites. Otherwise they would make the sale for next day air. You can call UPS and FEDEX to do a late pick up. But I was calling at 1:30pm-2:30pm CST.\n\nUPDATE: I didn't want the word out that I didn't have a burner. A friend was going to rig his 20 year old trusty burner with a 100 gal propane tank, but luckily someone stopped by with their CAMP CHEF burner. It worked beautifully. Stay away from aluminum stock pots in cold weather. Aluminum radiates heat away from your boiling point. Takes 25 minutes to boil water with a half full 60 quart aluminum stock pot even with high psi and high btu burners.\n\nIf you want to build and run a successful business, learn how to STOCK INVENTORY and ship LATE LATE LATE in the day. I run a small business and we ship up until 7:00PM via UPS and FEDEX hubs. 70% of our sales are last minute buyers after 3:00PM looking to receive their item next day air... even Saturday Delivery. We've saved thousands of people and companies from disaster.\n\nRoll the dice on Bayou Classic CHINESE made products.","summary":"Did NOT come with the Regulator.

Havahart has a better solution to keep those pesky night critters away from your garden and trash.  The Spray Away Elite II uses a long, wide, hard blast of water to keep the night creatures out of your plants and vegetables.  It's motion sensor activated and you can adjust the sensitivity.  Even at the lowest setting I've found the blast of water to be quite effective.  The base holds a large amount of water so you are not filling it up all the time.  There is a warning light to tell you when it's low and another to tell you when the solar power is running out.  The sprinkler is not too heavy so it's easy to move around.  The material is high quality plastic and stays looking good even after the harshest storms. My garden has gone untouched this year with little effort by me and all the effort by the Spray Away Elite II.  Just remember to walk around the rear of it when it's on or you're going to get a nice little blast yourself.","summary":"Keeps the critters away humanely","unixReviewTime":1369958400,"style":{"Size:":" 1-Pack"},"image":null}

This kit is for any mower with a Briggs & Stratton 3.5 to 6.5 QUANTUM Series engine.  The Quantum engines have a vertically mounted air filter unit on the forward right side of the engine, which utilizes a paper air filter element with an integral blue foam gasket, overall dimension 4.4\" x 5\" (B&S part number 491588S, which is printed on the side of the paper filter media).\n\nOK, if you've got the right mower match, let me comment that this is a very nicely put together kit.  It all comes enclosed in a plastic container and contains everything you need for basic annual maintenance and storage.  Price is very competitive, especially if you add a little extra value considering the top of the container converts to a re-usable funnel and the body to a used oil catch can (or for me, a handy parts bin for new and old mower parts, or nuts & bolts, etc.).  The contents are name brand parts\/products, not a collection of cheap compatibles.\n\nIncluded in the kit:  1. 20 oz bottle of SAE 30 Champion brand 4-cycle lawn mower motor oil.  2. Briggs & Stratton air filter for the Quantum engine. 3. Champion Copper Plus spark plug.  4. 2.5 oz bottle of Champion Fuel Stabilizer, enough to treat over 5 gallons of gasoline (in your storage can) and the fuel in your mower's tank.  As I mentioned, the container also provides a funnel and small parts bin.\n\nA good idea and a decent deal.","summary":"Great All-in-One Kit","unixReviewTime":1367020800,"style":null,"image":null}

This summer I purchased a 12' x 30\" Intex frame pool.  I did quite a bit of reading & everything I read pretty much said I needed a bunch of chemicals.  I purchased this kit, but it doesn't come with instructions for first time chemical users.  When I used the shock I figured out on my own that I needed to dissolve it in a bucket of water before adding to the pool.  But still, a lot of the granules just sunk to the floor of the pool.  I didn't have much luck with this kit as my pool liner was usually slimy even though I measured all the chemicals just as instructed and added them in the order I understood them to be added.  The water was also discolored & smelled funny.  I remember reading about a mom using plain old house strength bleach in her pool.  She said it worked great.  So I did the same, and wah lah!  It actually stopped my liner from being slimy, stopped the discoloration of the water, and the smell is now gone!!  I imagine that in the pool world they would probably frown upon me for using bleach for one reason or another, but it works for me so I'm gonna continue using it.  It's also WAY cheaper than all those confusing chemicals.  I added 4 cups initially to clear up all the gunk then 2 cups in the evening after swimming when running the pump.

Anyway initially it turned half of the pond a dark blue color, along with the weeds.  Panicked some of the fish and the turtles avoided the blue initially.  Watched it slowly spread for a while then left.  Next day it looked alot different.  Was more green then before but expected that because of how cloudy the water in my pond has been.  It has spread all through the pond though its still alot darker on the side where I sprayed it.  Waiting to see how it looks next week.  Will edit this and put in how its doing then.

I bought one when our sprinkler system broke, and I had to water the front yard with one of those sprinklers that you hook up to a hose.  I didn't want to leave a hose lying across the front walk all the time for people to trip on, but I also didn't relish the idea of uncoiling and coiling a heavy hose every day.  The Pocket Hose was perfect for that.  It's very lightweight and you don't have to coil it.  It was easy to attach to my portable sprinkler, and when I was done watering, I could just gather it up and dump it in a clay pot in my flower bed.\n\nI'm actually thinking about ordering a 2nd one in a longer length for my back yard.  I have an extensive container garden back there that I have to water daily.  My big black 100' rubber hose is a hassle to drag around and coil back up.  And on hot summer days, I have to spend several minutes bleeding the hot water from it.  I'm hoping maybe the pocket hose won't heat up like that, and I won't have to waste so much water.\n\nA few caveats, though:\n\nFirst of all, it's true that the connectors on each end are just plastic, and the little plastic nozzle thing broke the first time I tried to screw it on tight.  But I discovered that part is not really necessary, especially if you're connecting it to a trigger or sprayer mechanism, or some other hose accessory.  You do need to be reasonably gentle with the plastic parts, though.\n\nSecondly, some people have complained that the hose doesn't instantly retract into a little ball as small as the original packaging.  That's true.  It basically just goes limp, and the material is lightweight and thin enough that you can then scrunch it into a ball and drop it into a bucket, flower pot, or one of those fancy ceramic things for hoses.  I find that very convenient, but if you're looking for it to scrunch itself up into a tiny ball when you turn the water off, it doesn't do that.\n\nA few people have complained that the hose develops leaks.  I haven't found that to be the case yet, but I'm not really subjecting it to a lot of brutal use - dragging it across rocks or leaving it out in the sun for long periods of time, for example.  I'm just connecting it to a sprinkler or hose trigger to water the lawn and shrubs, and so far (about 3 months), I've not had any leaking problems.\n\nBottom line, this is a cleverly designed product that is unfortunately not made with very high quality materials.  But if you're the kind of person who hates lugging around, coiling, and storing a regular garden hose, you still might find it worth buying.  Just be gentle with it.\n\nUpdate:  Hose ended up exploding violently when the lining failed.  This was a spot about a foot from the spigot, on a part of the hose that doesn't touch the ground or come into contact with anything sharp.  It just couldn't withstand the water pressure coming out of the tap, even though I had nothing attached to the other end of the hose (trigger, sprinkler, etc).  It's too bad, because the general concept and design of the hose is great.  It just needs to be made of much stronger material.","summary":"Not the best quality, but works for my purposes","unixReviewTime":1371600000,"style":{"Size:":" 50 Feet","Color:":" Green"},"image":null}

The only negative is that there were no set-up instructions, but it was easy to figure out in one minute. We also bought the starter cubes, which as advertized have no odor, no after taste, and are easy to light. There was a strong breeze which made the matches go out, so we moved the grill to the inside of a permanent picnic area grill, where ours was shielded from the wind, and the cubes started right up and the coals were hot within 5 minutes. There were no instructions on the cubes either, so we used 4 of them inside the Quick Grill,  and maybe we could have used fewer. When the picnic was over we dumped the hot coals inside the picnic area grill, and when cool we put our grill into a plastic bag and home into a dishpan to clean, then  back into the carry bag. The metal discolored, but of course that is to be expected.  If you love picnics, but hate lugging bulky stuff, buy this.","summary":"This was a hit!","unixReviewTime":1393113600,"style":null,"image":null}

I specifically purchased them because of their depth.  Plants like tomatoes need depth to accommodate their root system.  I was also intrigued by the fact that you can combine two planters into one long, deep planter, to accommodate the rambling vines of squash and pumpkin, which is what I ultimately decided to do.  Overall, I am okay with the product.  It serves the purpose for which I purchased it.  However I only gave it three stars because the wood was not finished very well.  Instead of the corner posts being smooth inside, they were frayed as if they needed to be sanded which is what I did by hand.  I sanded it so that the boards would more smoothly glide in.  Even so, installing the boards is not an easy task. Take care to line each board up properly and use force to snugly push them down.  With respect to the \"decorative\" tops, they too are rough and are simply a square with slanted edges.  The picture makes them look rather smooth.  They are not smooth.  Also, you will need a power drill to secure them to the posts since the pre-drilled holes are not completely drilled through.  If you are not concerned with depth or flexibility of size, go for Suncast WGB48 48-inch cedar wood raised garden kit.  Smoothly manufactured and the smell of cedar is evident the minute you take it out of the box.  No tools are required.  However, the stake that you secure the boards and drive into the ground makes the structure somewhat permanent to where you place it.","summary":"Deep, Flexible But Roughly Hewn","unixReviewTime":1370908800,"style":{"Color:":" Wood"},"image":null}

While their instructions tell us to use these in spring and fall, I tend to use them in spring only as I don't want to interrupt the trees' fall dormancy cycle with a burst of new growth. A couple of things I've learned:\n\n1. When I first tried these, I would put them right next to the base of the tree or shrub so the fertilizer would drip into the roots. I ended up partially killing a small tree this way.... follow the directions and put them in the dripline of the tree and let the trees' roots reach them. If it's a new planting, suggest you use a liquid fertilizer or a granular release surface fertilizer instead of pounding these into a small root ball... learn from my mistake.\n\n2. To pound them in, I wet the soil and if it's tightly compacted I stab it a few times with a small shovel or garden spade.\n\nI was curious why these are banned in Pinellas County (St. Petersburg, FL) and did some research... they are concerned about phosphate-based fertilizers and their impact on Florida's dwindling water supply, so they have banned them. I used to live on a lake in Florida and the whole thing was covered in an algae bloom due to all the fertilizer running off from the bright green lawns that ringed the lake.\n\nVery effective, highly recommended. I would very much like to see MIracle Gro develop some organic versions of all my favorites....these spikes and the \"blue crystals\" that go in the feeders.\n\nHope this helps.","summary":"These work well, but don't put them too close to the base \/ trunk of your tree","unixReviewTime":1425686400,"style":{"Size:":" 3 LB"},"image":null}

I lent it out in the cold weather and it came back with a frozen pump manifold. With that in mind, I ordered this unit, which is very close to the same machine that I have been using. The changes made on this machine in comparison to my old one, are only for the better. It does have a slightly lower hose pressure and HP engine, but this seems to not make any difference.\nThis unit has a slightly more flexible hose, which is great. It will actually hang on the hose holder. It comes with three spray ends: one is a single hard stream, another is a hard pressure fan shape and the other is a fan which is not high pressure. This one is low pressure for rinsing, etc.\nThis machine as well as my old one always starts on 2-3 pulls. Though it says it can use gas with up to 10% ethanol, at the advice of a small engine repair guy, I only use straight gas with no ethanol.  There is no gas\/oil mixing.\nThis unit is easy to move around, and for storage, the handle, and hose come off. The extra hose ends have an easy on\/off ring on the wand. You can change the type of pressure stream easily. The extra wand ends are stored on the handle.\nI have found that when you remove the pressure hose, make sure that you let out the pressure with engine and water supply off, at the trigger. This makes it very easy to turn the hose connection off of the pump pipe. You can easily do it by hand.  I found out the hard way on my old unit, that by forcing the hose off of the pump connection, it is easy to strip the hose threads. This was a $125. lesson. I was also told by the repair guy that it is unwise to leave the power washer engine running without the water going through the wand for more than a very short time. The engine is cooled by the water going through it.\nIncidentally...I ordered a pump manifold on Amazon for my old washer, put it on myself, and it now works as well. Parts are available for these units. I have been very happy with the quality of the Briggs. It has good pressure, always starts and it has been reliable.","summary":"Reliable power washer","unixReviewTime":1527120000,"style":{"Style:":" 2200 psi 1.9 gpm"},"image":null}

Reviews are all we can rely on to make the decision. Well the reason I settled on this one is because it offers an enclosure with a quarter cutout window. I can't say enough about how well this product works. I put it to use immediately out of the box and suspended it using a shower rod. With so many levels, I had no trouble spreading herbs loosely on each level. This drying rack is very well made and bigger than I expected. I was very pleased seeing the actual size was larger than it appears to be in the picture. Net construction allows air flow throughout with no air restrictions whatsoever. Very much worth the cost.

One person could put this up without too much trouble.\nCONS:\n1. The knob that latches and secures the legs in place got dislodge on one of the legs. Had to remove the bottom portion of the leg and maneuver it back into place.\n2. The bags is already starting to show signs of wear and developing holes. This bag does not appear to be as durable as my EZ-Up bag which is still in pretty good shap after 10 years of use.\n\nTo sum it all up, this is a nice looking, easy to use shade.

One of the corner legs was bent toward the inside.  It almost looks like it fell on the corner -- although it seems hard to imagine how something that big could have dropped on one corner.

My husband was able to stand on the corner leg long enough for it to straighten out but he gave me a lot of dirty looks.\n\nThis is a sturdy, good-looking lounge.  It is very lightweight and easy to move around.  My teenager and I carried it upstairs very easily and then downstairs again when my husband didn't like where I put it.  The core of it feels sturdy.  The resin-wicker part of it feels plasticized which will make it last much longer as an outdoor piece of furniture.  The cushion is fabric covered, not that plastic sticky stuff that you get stuck to while sun bathing.\n\nThis lounge is the perfect size for me more than anyone else in my house.

In the full flat position, I am the only one who can lie on it comfortably.\n\nMy 6' tall husband could not find any way to sit that was comfortable.

I went over for dinner a few nights ago and she has no flies...Asked her how she did it...She said I did what you said Dad and sprinkled a bit of bait on some dog poop & picks the rest up.  Easy safe and works... Start early and it keeps the population down all around...Same at my house we have no flies. Started early & sprayed Temprid SC to areas sun hit first.  I could not find anyplace to use the bait effectively...I did stoop to a stinky bait station...put it inside a trellis and dropped it down low so doesn't look so bad and have flowers growing around it...It has picked up a few flies in 2 weeks.  If you get that one fly it is important...Wish I had a good way for mosquitoes...we had to spray them with pyrethrin.

At my previous house I had landscaping done about 13 years before I sold it, but only had deep root fertilizing done, professionally, the last two years.  I believe it helped sell the house.  Everything in the landscaping finally popped in the Spring of 2011. We sold the house, ourselves, in 6 weeks.  Needless to say, I was determined to have it done here, with extensive landscaping already in place. I photographed the sequence of the plants blooming last year, mostly to identify them, but did not do any fertilization last year.  I finally got around to addressing the landscaping this year, and had the time to concentrate on it because the weather remained very cool throughout the Spring.  I have even done some transplanting into late May this year.  I bought the Ross Deep Root Feeder device and several types of fertilizer refills, in time to make the rounds with it at the end of April.  I was very surprised to see the results a month later.  I used this particular product on the trees and non-flowering shrubs, the acid-loving refills on the evergreens, and the flowering shrub refills on all the flowering plants, including the azaleas and rhododendrons.  The blossoms on the rhododendrons are now larger than on any I have previously owned; and the azaleas look like they are straining to stretch their flowers open beyond their normal capabilities.  And the bees are going insane on the sea roses.  One bee was literally rolling around in one of those flowers, as if it was in a state of absolute euphoria. And the Weigela look fabulous, even though I cut them back severely just before I fertilized them.  I will be fertilizing again in the fall, but only using the acid loving and this fertilizer, so the plants will go back to building energy for their infrastructure. I can hardly wait to see the Montauk Daisies this year.  Those were fertilized with flowering fertilizer first, then get general fertilizer monthly until they bloom, because they get severely cut back early on and need energy to regrow.  And then there will be next year...","summary":"Made a very noticeable and quick difference","unixReviewTime":1370217600,"style":{"Size:":" 12 Refills","Style:":" Trees & Shrubs"},"image":null}

Only reason for not getting five stars was that the retaining ring at the bottom of the metal rod holding the poison bait is practically welded on.

I believe the current price was about $20 less than I paid for my original purchase and the new one is almost identical. The only change that I noticed is that Toro has added an additional grip on the handle and replaced the male plug in the base for a corded plug in. My original went bad because of an internal short at the plug-in and perhaps this design change was aimed at preventing that from happening. There are lots of leaf blowers out there but this one has been on the market for a long time and still gets great reviews.

I will say that lack of power I mentioned in my original review is the major flaw.  The good news is that (a) The mower always started on two or less pulls.  One pull after winter storage with Sta-Bil in the fuel. (b) Emptying the bag is manageable if you don't let it get more than 2\/3 full.  That's a PITA with a small bag and lots of grass or leaves, but it does work fine that way. (c) I found the wheels easy to adjust with the mower on a paved surface.\nNOTE - While shopping for a new mower this spring I notice that the successor to this model now has an even weaker B&S motor.  See my comments on the 10632.\n\nUpdate - Fall of 2012 (downgraded from 3 to 2 stars)\nI kept the mower against my better judgement, so as to have one handy for \"quick mows.\"  What a mistake.\nI just mowed our small front lawn.  I had to push the mower up the modest slope with a  a lot of effort with the bag even half full.  It could not have been any harder to push with a manual mower.  To make it worse, the mower filled its tiny bag quickly with only a modest amount of grass and leaves and then spit out half-mulched leaf fragments.  The opening to the bag is so small that it clogs easily, making the leaf-spitting problem worse.  After a summer's use, I really can't say much good about this mower other than it still starts on the first or second pull and cuts grass.\nI am giving it away to my son who has a flat and treeless postage stamp lawn.\nBuy something else, it can't be worse.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW - June 2012 - \"Not Your Father's Lawn Boy - Low on Muscle\"\nA nice mower, but sorely lacking on power.  Fine if you have a flat clean lawn.  Poorly suited for anything else.\n\nI have owned a self-propelled 2-cycle lawn Boy Silver Series mower for the past 13 years.  It is lightweight, maneuverable, powerful, cuts well, and has proven simple to maintain.  I have periodically serviced the carburetor and replace the magneto coil once.  I thought I'd try one of the new Lawn Boy models when my current one failed to start last week.  The 10604 seemed a good choice.\n\nThe mower came thoughtfully packaged for removal and with the required oil.  It was \"on the air\" in ten minutes.  Unlike some others, I found the mow height adjustment easy to make.  I set both front and back to 3\" in my first cutting.\n\nMy mowing experience with the Lawn Boy 10604 is based on cutting my 2,000 sq ft back yard and 1,200ft front yard once each.  The mower always started both cold and hot on the first pull and quickly settled into smooth running.  The bag is smaller that the one on my older Lawn Boy, but adequate.  The safety door makes taking it off and on more of a pain than the \"less safe\" older bag.  The bag is held by two pins in an adequate but rather cheesy bracket. This mower IS indeed variable speed.  You just need to develop a feel for the control.  It was the same on my old Lawn Boy.\n\nHere's the deal-breaker disappointment for me.  I found myself having to push on a moderate slope in the yard.  The mower acted more like power-assist than self-propelled.  It would not have moved forward without help.  It was fine on level ground.  This lack of power was also reflected in the poor grass lifting capacity.  My old 6.5HP mower easily moved up the slope and, when set at 3\" cut, lifted up long grass and cut it.  The new Lawn Boy did a poor job of pulling the long grass to cutting height, nor did it pick up even the smallest bits of branch debris.\n\nI had been a bit worried about power judging from a few of the reviews, but assured myself it would be fine since I don't rally have a hill, just a gentle slope.  I was wrong.  As an aside, the Kohler motor has a big \"6.5\" printed on the cover.  Smaller lettering says it is torque, not horsepower.  I saw the mower only on a high shelf at the HD before buying it and missed the torque part of the label.  Simply put, the 149cc motor is inadequate for anything deviating more than a few degrees from flat.\n\nI'll be taking the 10604 Back.  Unfortunately I can't find a Lawn Boy with a more powerful motor.  I will be looking at other brands.  And yes, I'll be fixing my old LB too :-)\n\nOverall it's a nice little mower, but not good for anywhere but flat terrain.","summary":"Not Your Father's Lawn Boy - Final UPDATE","unixReviewTime":1339027200,"style":null,"image":null}

I had moved 2 years ago to a house where the soil is actually almost sterile. I have put so much organic admendments to the ground and the plants were still struggling here. I had a Kishu  Mandarin tree that was planted wrong by a landscaper and it looked completely dead.i really had no hope for it and really thought I lost the tree. I found a little green above the graph line and applied this along with high Brix molasses and within 3 weeks period of time, this stuff brought my poor little kishu tree back to life. It now has about three feet of lush Healthy Growth all around it, I was totally shocked on how well this tree is now doing. I also saw a huge difference in the other newly planted trees, they all seem to be growing quicker and not stressing from the heat. My potted hibiscus plants which are all root bound with the old soil in it, every one of them after applying this ended up being very green and the new growth is three times bigger than before and the flowers on the hibiscus plants are almost saucer size. They look like they do came from the florist. My geraniums that were struggling are now Lush and very green and so many flowers on them they look like they came from a magazine. I also use this on my root bound fig trees, the new growth on them are huge. The leafs are the size of my head instead of my palm on my hands and they're producing figs way before they should. There fig is already bigger then the ripe ones last year. I also use this on a very tired old orange tree and was shocked to see the tree go from crappie looking to a very dense lush green orange tree and the massive amount of fruit on it is just incredible. My lime tree that was showing deficiency in micronutrients in the leafs. I had applied everything that it needed but the trees still was deficient. After I applied recharge about 7 Days Later all of my leaves are very Lush green and no longer showed any deficiency sign and the tree is just putting out a massive amount of new growth and now the tree is bearing an unbelievable amount of fruit. All of my potted plants also are showing great signs of being absolutely healthy and lush, they are all full of huge flowers or fruit. My boysenberry Vine the leaves are so big on them now compared to the older growth and already producing a lot of fruit, I just planted them. They were bare root. This stuff actually really does work, it is amazing.  It is hard to grow stuff here in Arizona with our Heat and it seems the plants are not stressing as much. There is comments about the stuff getting everywhere and it is real fine like baby powder but it is very easy to use. I just used it in a tree well in case any spilled it blown away the plant would get extra. You can put it in a Ziploc bag and use it from to thier. I used about a heaping teaspoon in a gallon of water, a teaspoon of molasses and a teaspoon of fish emulsion to ensure to activate and feed the enzymes when I applied this to the plants. I use this formula on all of the potted plants and just saturated the soil and the gallon container fed several pots depending on the size. For the plants or trees in the ground, I used a heaping teaspoon and applied it in my gallon container of water and then applied it to each of the tree wells. For the orange tree which is about 15 ft tall by 15 ft wide I used 3 heaping tablespoons completely around the tree well and drip line. I would put the little bag in the tree well and scoop out what I needed and if any would spill the tree would get extra. This size bag will go a long way and I've made a tea out of it to expand the use of it also. The product works really well and works really fast and does unlock any of the nutrients in the ground to release it to the plant to use. This has saved a lot of my poor plants that were dying and not doing well or not doing much. I cannot wait to see how Lush and beautiful everything will be in a few months. I will be buying this in a bigger bag. But this is something great to add life to any yard or potted plants. You can also use this for indoor plants and medical plants also. I highly recommend this for absolutely everybody.

The WorkX handled them without clogging. The leaf mulch produced by the metal impeller allows one to use less lawn bags by a factor of 2 or 3 in my estimation.

A Magill","reviewText":"In outdoor furniture the challenge is always balancing \"look\" and \"maintenance.\"  Assuming that this Highwood recliner lives up to expectations, the product certainly comes down on the side of maintenance.  Not to be overly critical, but I find it hard to imagine that anybody could mistake this chair for wood, unless they wore both blind and tactily deficient.  Perhaps at a significant distance (in bad light), but within five feet you know you are looking at something made of plastic and by touch that becomes still more clear. That can of course be okay. There's nothing wrong with plastic in outdoor furniture, but the effort to imitate wood failing badly seems to me a strike against this product. Further, I suspect that this problem is made worse in \"Weathered Acorn.\"  Likely in other options -- the white especially -- this will not be such an issue.\n\nIn terms of assembly, I found the process a bit challenging.  Thirty years and three kids into assembling different types of furniture, this certainly falls on the more difficult end.  More than anything my issues resulted from the poor quality of the instructions.  The pictures included in the  instructions were photographs each taken scant inches from the point where I was inserting a screw.  Time and again I found myself referring back to the larger picture to better orient myself with regards to the whole chair. Moreover, while someone could probably put it together as they direct, I suspect many will be reaching for a flashlight (the guide holes are hard to find, especially when trying to attach three pieces on one bolt) and dropping the wrench in favorite of a socket wrench (some of the angles are challenging).  Is it really so difficult to write good directions with easy to comprehend images?  That said, the whole assembly took a little less than an hour.\n\nComfort remains, of course, the highest priority.  In this the chair succeeds and one can easily imagine lazying away afternoons reading or listening to music reclining in one of its three settings (though at $360, a cushion seems in order).\n\nWhile I rarely think it proper to critique other folks reviews, I do have to disagree on one point when it comes to this item.  Some have described it as heavy, but I found the opposite to be the case.  A wood chair would be  heavier and feel more substantive.\n\nAs you should be able to guess, I'm pretty ambivalent about this product. If you value low maintenance above all and don't care that it looks more like plastic wood than real wood, than this may be the chair for you. I've gone through more than my share of wooden deck furniture that made it two seasons before self junking.  At $360,  perhaps more than anything you are purchasing this chairs warranty (12 years for residential use and 8 years for commercial).  Even so, $360 feels like a lot of money for what you are getting. I'd likely have felt somewhat different if they either had done a better job making the chair \"feel\" like wood, or hadn't tried quite so hard and plainly failed.","summary":"Okay, but expensive for what you get","unixReviewTime":1362355200,"style":{"Size:":" King","Color:":" Weathered Acorn"},"image":null}

Welcome to the new millennium!!!  There simply isn't a good backyard grill out there at a decent price anymore.  I advise taking expanded metal and making briquette baskets to keep the heat as far away from the metal as possible and finding charcoal that burns well with minimal charcoal lighter fluid.  (Kindle, available at \"Save a Bunch!\")  Also, keeping DRY ashes in the bottom of the grill will help insulate the metal, but I must emphasize DRY ASHES.  Ashes have lye that is activated by water, ergo rust!  And be prepared to repaint occasionally.  Closing on a positive note, I always have briquettes that fully burn left over, so apparently it seals adequately.

Here in Georgia the sun takes a terrible toll on almost everything that's exposed outside. The sun just cooked the previous units after about a year. What's nice about the new units is thepoo control is all in the house with air conditioning. The control unit and the valve in my home is approximately 70 feet apart and down one floor. The unit still works fine, gives feedback to the control unit, and you can turn the valves on and off from inside the house if you choose to be on manual control. Another nice feature is that you can control the unit from anywhere in the world that has access to the internet. That way if it starts raining I can shut all the valves off without having to go outside and get wet. The app that controls the unit is extremely easy to program and use. Well worth the money.\n\n7\/27\/17 - After a month of having this unit I'm not as optimistic as I was. The moisture accessory is not as reliable as it was in the older unit. In fact, it's rather hairy-fairy. There also seems to be a belligerence to switch from auto to manual and has an annoying habit of dropping out of sync with the control unit. At the present, I'll say it's inclined to be frustrating. Unfortunately, there isn't another unit on the market to replace it. In addition, they don't have an app that will run on a PC.\n\n3\/1\/18 Well, it's now been about eight months. I found out that this unit has a definite weakness in that the control unit has a hard time staying online. I go into it with my notepad and find it's offline and therefore I doubt if any of the functions would work. I've had the control unit replaced once and I still get the same results. Keep in mind that I've been in electronics all my life and bought my first IBM computer in 1982 and was the data specialist for AT&T before I retired. I've been working with computer problems for the better part of 30 years. Frankly I think this unit is flaky I wish the heck a new competitor would come out with all the features that the Melnor has.\n\n3\/10\/18\nAt this point I'm so totally frustrated I'm going to bunch the whole thing and return to my Orbit irrigation timers that have no wireless. Melnor replaced the control unit and the valves and I still get the same results. Maybe the control program just doesn't like Samsung tablets or phones. Strange, because I have Nest thermostats, Alexa units, two stationary computers, a tablet and a phone, Roku and a Sony blue ray player all working on the same 60 megabyte internet line. All without any problems whatsoever. So Melnor goes into the useless junk box. Good luck if you want to try one. Hope you have more success than I did. Google rates the software at 2.7. That in itself ought to tell you a lot.\n\n6\/28\/18 after countless failures to get this machine up and working consistently I've decided the best place for it is in the garbage can. At this point it's impossible to determine if it's the Android software, the Spectrum Wi-Fi or the Melnor unit. I'm not going to buy a new tablet or switch over to one of the crummier internet providers on the off-chance that they are causing the problem so the best thing to do is garbage can the unit and forget it. If you decide to buy one, good luck don't say you haven't been warned. If I get a review this product with 0 Stars I would have done it. This is the most disappointing product I've ever purchased from Amazon and I've been with them for a long time.\n\nI'm sure you've heard Nat King Cole sing the song Unforgettable.

{"overall":4,"vote":"70","verified":true,"reviewTime":"06 26, 2016","reviewerID":"A235FTJ4VL068Z","asin":"B00FGEINVI","reviewerName":"rjeffb","reviewText":"Mine was a 2014 Q320(0). Wonderful grill, outstanding heat uniformity. Cooks better than any grill I've ever owned, HUGE heat output contained tightly within the porcelain top means great searing. The LED light is a gimmick and should simply be dropped; the heat quickly kills the battery and renders the light useless (idea: make it solar-powered rechargeable; do you really need six hours per night of light to grill especially considering that the light only illuminates when the lid is open?). The 2014 ignition is an exercise in patience as it took up to ten tries to ignite, including playing games like shutting down and opening the lid and trying again; I see the igniter looks different on the new version and perhaps they have fixed that.\n\nLeft it unattended with both burners on medium. Came back half an hour later and the grill had melted its way down through the plastic and the lid had embedded itself into the U-tube underneath. I mean it melted more than an inch down. Cracked the lid trying to work its way free of the plastic. The grill not only destroyed itself but it could have been an actual fire\/explosion hazard - I see reviews of the grill catching fire and I can see how that have happened very easily. Most frustrating, the stand is absolutely undamaged and I can't seem to find the grill (either old or new) by itself to use with the old stand and save some money. I'm ordering a new one and hoping these problems have been fixed, because it genuinely is a great grill.\n\nExcept, that is, when it melts!\n\nEDIT: Cancelled the order (actually refused delivery per Amazon customer service instructions) as Weber came through at the last moment and confirmed it was in-warranty (five years, and they had the serial number on file so I didn't have to come up with a receipt - that's worth a star back and I'll jump it to four stars if and when I get the replacement and confirm it works).\n\nAlthough I could not convince the not-very-technical customer support person to let me speak with one of the design engineers (\"sir, I am sure they know all about this and these problems are always caused by grease\" - uh, no, radiant heat decreases by the inverse square of distance and radiated energy increases by the fourth power of the absolute temperate and by the way I'm a physicist and a grease flareup is not why your cookbox MELTED the cradle), I have a suspicion I know what actually caused this. At the time, the lid was down but slightly open to allow the handles of some kebab baskets to poke out. As anyone who has ever worked with a long-flue furnace (like a coke furnace or a smelting furnace) knows, the temperature goes up tremendously when you get a draft blowing through. A fire is never hottest when it is completely exposed, too much air cools the fire more than the additional oxygen heats it. Your hottest temperature is when air has partial, but not complete, access to the outside so it creates a partial vacuum and sucks high-speed air in through venturi effect. In one place, the instructions say to cook with the lid \"closed\" but in most places it says to cook with the lid \"lowered.\" I'll bet that the lid is really supposed to be completely closed and if it is cracked open just the right amount and the gas output is set just right, this grill turns into a furnace. I didn't think to look at the thermometer readout but it must have been fantastically high, two years' worth of charcoal buildup inside the lid was completely gone (the inside of the lid looks like it just came out of the box) and I see on Wikipedia that's at least 660 degrees F (the built in thermometer PEGS at 600) and can go as high as >1,000< degrees...that's no grease flareup!\n\nFOLLOW UP: I eventually received all the replacement parts (when Weber said they would replace the \"cookbox\" I thought they meant the entire cooker, but that turned out to be just the bottom, so I had to subsequently request a lid, cradle, and igniter switch - the light was also melted but I didn't bother with that). Oddly the lid is jet black, I thought they only came in gray and red. Anyway, back in business and back up to four stars. By the way, the new cradle sits higher than the old one (I can clearly see the drip pan between the cooker and the cradle, whereas before I could not) and upon inspection I found that they have added ceramic discs to the feet of the cooker, no doubt to insulate the plastic from heat and prevent exactly the kind of meltdowns that I experienced. Also, the new design has limited airflow intakes on either side that greatly boost cooking temperature - with both burners set to medium (and remember, the burners weren't replaced, so these are the originals) temperature climbs to over 500 degrees. On medium! So while it is annoying that I'm burning burgers while learning to adapt to the improved heating (I'll start cooking stuff at low, or using only one burner and save gas), that tells me that they have made tremendous overall improvements. Oh and even though the igniter element is original, with the new igniter activator installed I'm now getting lights at the first or at most second try.\n\nTwo and a half stars for the one I originally bought; four and a half stars for the current model.","summary":"Great until it MELTED","unixReviewTime":1466899200,"style":{"Style:":" Liquid Propane"},"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Z2QYX39rL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81fKAvbla6L._SY88.jpg"]}

Hill","reviewText":"I just bought my fourth Nelson 50503 High Pressure Sprayer in about 9 years.  The first one lasted about 6 years, and then I have gone through about one every year since.  They are heavily built, and feel very solid, but they fail way too often.  The reason I keep buying them is they are the only spray head that will deliver the water flow that I need with my hose setup.  I tapped in to the same water source that feeds my in-ground sprinkler system.  This tap is BEFORE the 75 PSI regulator that controls pressure to the house.  This makes a big difference in having a garden hose and sprayer that will actually get some work done.\n\nI have 3\/4 inch copper pipe that enters the house from the city.  I think pressure is 120 or 130 PSI.  From the 3\/4 inch feeder I tapped in with 1\" pipe, and use nothing but 1 inch pipe, with one inch fittings, including a 1 inch shut-off valve.  I did this since many of the 3\/4 valves actually do not have a full 3\/4 inch flow, so you never get the full use of the 3\/4\" pipe.  That is why I went with 1 Inch.  Then I use a very heavy 3\/4 inch garden hose, and then the Nelson Spray head.  This is the only head that will handle the water flow, and it works like a champ.  The issue is the quality.  When it works, it works well, but I have had 3 failures in about 3 years, all of them different type of failures, including leaking, handle breaking and then the last one just fell apart all of a sudden.  Weird.\n\nI would change brands, but this is the only one that actually works, and has about at 60 foot throw, with lots of water.\n\nI feel bad giving it 2 stars, since I like the way it works.  If they did not fail so often it would be 5+.stars.","summary":"Works like a champ, but should be more reliable.","unixReviewTime":1433635200,"style":{"Color:":" Fireman's"},"image":null}

Mind you, I have never had a pump sprayer before, so I am not an expert. But after trying for two years to spray organic pesticide with recycled Windex or Method bottles, I got tired of hand cramps, and small, spotty, coverage, and the pump sprayer seems wonderful.\n\nThe pump mechanism is also the top. It is easy to open and locks securely. It is also easy to pump up the pressure ; the piston moves smoothly, although it squeaks. When open, the mouth of the bottle is fairly large, with a wide collar around it to catch spills and direct them into the bottle. The collar can help balance a strainer if, like me, you mix DIY fungicide\/pest repellent* and want to strain it into the bottle. The hose inside the bottle does have a fine-mesh, built-in strainer, but I didn't want to gunk it up. The plastic bottle is lightweight, which makes it easy to carry, and hold while spraying. I have knocked it over many times without damage. I have been using it a few times a week for 2 months. The spray is steady, not a firehose by any means, but distributes enough liquid to really wet the plants after one pass above and below.\n\nI enthusiastically recommend this product for weekend gardener who grows vegetables and wants to give up on expensive, toxic sprays.\n\n*2 cloves garlic, 1\/4 cup cedar chips, 1 tbsp tea tree oil, 1 tbsp Sals Suds, 2 gals water. (I battled fungus, cabbage moths and aphids for two years. Now I just spray this everywhere after it rains. Tea tree oil is harmless to us and our pets; it's in dandruff shampoo. You can also use neem oil instead of tea tree.) Unfortunately, it did not work agaist vine borers. If you grow squash, you know what I mean.","summary":"Give up toxic sprays.

York","reviewText":"I bought this to replace an 11-year old Rain Bird ESP-8Si that was no longer working.  Being another Rain Bird product, I was relieved to find that my old wiring would plug directly into the new controller without any changes.  This made installation mindless and simple.  I labeled the zone controller wires for my 8 zones, unplugged them from the ESP-8Si, removed it, mounted the Smart Station, and then reattached the 8 zone wires.  Everything worked perfectly from there.\n\nOnce I had swapped in the controller, the only extra installation work I had to do was mount the remote weather sensor unit to my fence and run the line into the controller.  Once plugged in, I started seeing humidity readings on the controller.  When it rains, the sensor seems to detect this within 2-3 hours.  It will then stay in \"rain detect\" state for up to a few days until the sensor dries out.  Until the rain detection expires, it will not water your lawn.  I love this feature!\n\nWe've had some sub-40 degree (F) weather recently and, as advertised, the smart station did not water my yard when the temps dropped below 40.\n\nThe humidity readings are consistently too low for my area.  I live in Houston, Texas and we often have high humidity (as high as 100%).  The highest I've seen on the Smart Station is a reading of 63% (when the weather channel was reporting 100% humidity AND it was pouring rain).  When not raining, the highest humidity reading I've seen is 58% (when weather channel was reporting 100% humidity).\n\nIt took me a bit to rethink my lawn's schedule in the context of the new \"smart\" adaptive functionality of the new Rain Bird, but once done, I'm confident it will work better than my old unit.  I love the seasonal adjustment that reduces watering in the winter.  I used to \"manually\" do this in the past.  Now I can just forget about it and let the Rain Bird smart station do all the thinking.\n\nOverall, this is a nice and easy upgrade.  If you are somewhat careful with the wires, even someone with little technical skill can remove an old rain bird unit and hook up this one.","summary":"Nice upgrade","unixReviewTime":1355270400,"style":null,"image":null}

Now, it has faded in the sun to a gray color., but this is after 18+ months outside in the Texas sun. This cover has not cracked or peeled, and no birds or squirrels have been able to damage it. Birds do perch on the top of the firepit quite frequently and leave evidence of their visit, but I just hit it with the garden hose and it cleans right off.

The sock feeders get torn apart on feeding frenzies and the traditional slot feeders just don't have enough statios which leads to more fighting and less feeding.\nThe 17\" Bird Quest Spiral Thistle Bird Feeder has alleviated the fighting problem as the birds can go from ne port to the other by simply sliding down the spiral. In fact, they seem to derive a certain amount of enjoyment from sliding from port to port. I forget exactly how many ports are on this feeder but there are plenty.

It did not work as fast as I expected but it did work. So I just pulled it out to get ready for this winter.\n\nHere is what I learned based on my last year experience.  The mat works slowly, so it is best to turn it on before the storm prior to any snow fall.  I normally keep the mat unplugged and plug in only when the storm is predicted.  I am using it on a wood deck. The mat did not cause discoloration under the mat. I see no signs that the wood stain under the mat has aged faster compared to other parts of the deck. The mat never felt hot to touch, only somewhat warm.  Note that it only gets warm when the temperature is cold, keep that in mind if you are trying to test in the fall when it is not cold enough.  The mat is less than 1\/2\" thick but has a thicker bump where the cord is connected to the mat.\n\nThe size of the map is 24\" x 36\" and feels quite heavy.  It does not get lifted even by heavy winds.  The \"carpeted\" side should face up, the smooth side should face down.\n\nI also used the mat to melt icy patches on the deck. It took a long time to do the entire deck by moving the mat from spot to spot, but it was easier and caused less damage to the deck compared to trying to chip the ice off. I am using a 30 foot cord outdoor power cord and water-tight cord lock from Farm Innovators to protect the connection between the extension cord and the mat cord&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Farm-Innovators-Model-CC-2-Cord-Connect-Water-Tight-Cord-Lock\/dp\/B002MHFXS8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Farm Innovators Model CC-2 Cord Connect Water-Tight Cord Lock<\/a>\n\nI wish it was a bit larger and a bit cheaper, but overall satisfied with how it worked last winter.\n\nAli Julia review","summary":"Review after the first winter","unixReviewTime":1480204800,"style":null,"image":null}

I installed 10' sections of 4\" PVC drain pipe with these drainage emitters at ground level.  They worked exactly as I'd hoped... the water is now draining away from my home.  The emitters remain closed when not in use, opening only when necessary.  We mow our lawns at a 1-3\/4\" height with a power mower, and I've not had any problem with these.  I did actually change out the elbow... rather than using 4\" PVC Sewer and Drain pipe (which is the type of pipe the elbow is designed to work with,) I used Schedule 40 PVC drain pipe which is slightly larger and much heavier.  Using this pipe means that the pipe is far less likely to break and can certainly be cleaned out as necessary later on.  I had to pick up an adapter that I placed into the Schedule 40 elbow, then used only the green emitter portion from this part.  Some might say that's overkill, but it really didn't cost that much more to do it and I'm happy in the knowledge that I can clean this later as necessary, and that I won't have to replace the drain lines in the foreseeable future.","summary":"Works great!","unixReviewTime":1405728000,"style":null,"image":null}

There are still a few quality issues.  I have had to return 2 of the 4 I ordered.  I had a 75 ft. and 100ft. hose that the end blew off of it.  The captive brass fitting was loose and I peeked under it and noticed the outer sheath of the hose (fabric part) was not well captivated under the clamp.  Well it lasted a day or so.  When the hose blows off, the rubber internal hose shrinks without collapsing the outer sheath. I spent an hour feeding it back through and putting a generic clamp on the hose to fix it until I could return it.\n\nThe expanding hose is a different animal. You should take it off the hose reel before turning the water on or it will be a pain to get it off as it will tangle (mine is a simple wall hung hook type).  It works best if you let it fill before starting to use it.  I had two hooked together and if you run it wide open too long the hose shrinks, making it too short if using it at full length.  it takes a minute to shrink back down too before putting it away.\n\nLast issue is to please use thread locker on the screw holding the ball valve handle. I have had every one of them fall off, the screw head is not standard so you cannot just replace it if it's lost in the grass.  I had to grind down a socket head screw to replace it.\n\nOn the plus side, this hose is awesome.  I have hooked 200 ft of hose to fertilize my lawn and trees and it pulls across the grass like a dream.  I can wind 200 ft of hose on my reel and it looks like 75 ft of standard hose volume wise.

My pool has 2 skimmers and a bottom drain, if i didn't have all the extra intakes closed and my pump on high, the cleaner would not move at all. but the reason i am giving this 2 stars is because it would get stuck on something literly 5 minutes after i start it. I had to make sure the hose was short enough so that it couldn't reach my pool stairs because if it did it would get stuck in them and never come back. And as for the pool ladder i jsut had to hope that it would clean some of the pool before it found the ladder and got stuck waiting for me to free it. this would probably work fine for an above ground pool, but not for an inground with stairs and ladder.

I had all my grands with me to help with the planting and enough garden tools for everyone to use.  This would be the first time I had the opportunity to use this new garden trowel.  They are right!  This new design IS easier to use!  I found myself going back to using this garden trowel over and over throughout the day as we did our planting.

What I really loved about it is that it did not put the strain on my wrist that other hand tools do simply because the motion to use this tool is completely different.  If you have difficulty with your wrists hurting after gardening, this is the tool you will want to use!  The flat part of the tool was great for scraping the dirt from the wheelbarrow into the pots or onto the ground.

The tail gate is no problem to lift straight up and the dump works well.  I put the trailer over the area I want the rocks to go, remove the tailgate, engage the dump and drive forward.  The entire load empties out.  The hitch is OK but noisy when pulling.  The tailgate also rattles a bunch adding to the noise.  I place the tailgate in the back of my rig to lessen the noise.  Keeps the neighbors happy.  I will be converting the hitch to a ball soon.  By the way, I using a golf cart to move this rock and it works great.  If you can get this cart at a reasonable price it can do the job.","summary":"Nice little cart.","unixReviewTime":1442707200,"style":null,"image":null}

The massively cheap ignitor works for about six months, then is works 50 percent of the time , then it quits working entirely. How hard is it to spend 10 cents instead of five cents on a part that will work? Ask yourself that. During those six months when the sparker sorta worked and then always when it quit entirely I had \\ to disassemble the grill and that thing they call an infrared whatever (also garbage), and get my hands covered in black soot, and then try and light the grill with a match and not set myself on fire. This isn't an exaggeration. Everyone who really gives this grill five stars hasn't used it for diddly.

Because solder melts at relatively low temperatures this is not the can to use to heat water in.  It is not a multi-tasker.  It is beautiful and useful.  The copper is not lacquered so it can be polished using a good copper polish or jewelers cloth and it will need to be polished periodically to keep its 'out of the box' appearance.  I find the 2-pint\/1 Liter size is the 'right' balance between useful capacity and comfortable carrying\/pouring weight when full.  The classic Haws design with a copper tube supporting the long, flowing spout is stable and sturdy.  Water flows at a good rate and the long nose of the spout works well for placing water into the middle of a plant.  The brass rose is also well-made and provides a gentle spray that doesn't stray too far from the edge of the pot or planter.  As the manufacturer suggests, the rose is not best used on indoor pots and plants because there will be some over spray.  The rose slips on and off easily.  Good gardening tools give me extra pleasure every time I use them so I see value for the price in this item.  The packaging in the picture is also 'a step above' in quality, being fitted to accept the can.

But even then you can still order new parts and rebuild your feeder at a fraction of the cost of a new one.\n\nCustomer service at Droll Yankees is exemplary. The people there the best at what they do!\n\nUpdate 9\/17\/2013: If you have lots of squirrels at your feeders, sooner or later they will gnaw through anything.

I use it in flower beds as well as grass.  It has rust granules.\nWhereas the Scotts Moss Control Granules 31015 (least expensive) with gray granules isn't as effective at killing moss but add nutrients to lawns; this product is best used to keep moss at bay after the moss has been killed and, it has much less coverage than the 5000 sq ft claimed.  To be clear, this product does kill moss but much more product is needed.  I still had moss and had to order the 31005A rust granules to get the job done properly.  What initially appeared to been a saving was not in my case.\n\nFor my climate in the no snow wet coast with a lot of moss, I think it's best to apply the 31005A in early November and again in early spring to kill all the moss and use the 31005 to keep moss away and feed the grass during summer.\n\nThe names of the products are the same which is confusing but they are different products with a different purpose.","summary":"Difference with this product and the less expensive Scotts 31015","unixReviewTime":1399852800,"style":null,"image":null}

Then I set a couple bricks on each side of the mower deck and that has held it on. For just your regular weather, it will work fine. But like any of these tarps and covers, you might as well expect them to blow off in strong winds so you would be wise to prepare accordingly.\n\nUPDATE 8-28-2017: No complaints, it lasted about a year and 4 months before it developed a rip on the top at the seat area.

The engineer part of me LOVES the fact that electric smokers can maintain a constant smoker heat without constant monitoring and with the internal temp probe on my 40\" MES unit, I can get an accurate picture of how the is progressing. Best of both worlds? In a way - yes and in a way - no. Although I do get a reasonable smoke flavor infused into the meat using the standard chip feeder, it is much less pronounced than any of my previous grills. I ordered an A-Maze-N pellet smoke producer and my problem was solved. With the MES chip feeder removed and the vent open, the pellet smoke producer has provided between 10-15 hours of flavorful smoke. VERY convenient for anyone that does an all night \"low & slow\" cook. Smoke producers can also facilitate cold smoking of things like cheese, jerky and fish but I have never tried that so cannot comment on usefulness. (Seems logical though).\n\nThis unit is a breeze to clean, has plenty of room to smoke enough food for larger groups of people and (so far) has been a welcome and reliable part of my outdoor cooking experience.\n\nIf you want ease of operation - This is your unit! If you enjoy a stronger smoke flavoring - either plan to purchase a 3rd party smoke producer or stick with propane, wood chips or a pellet smoker.","summary":"Best of both worlds?","unixReviewTime":1449705600,"style":{"Size:":" 40 Inch","Color:":" Stainless","Style:":" Front Controller"},"image":null}

After the humidity reading settles down, note the discrepancy from 75 degrees, remove the AcuRite and let it adjust itself to the new humidity level outside the container. DON'T THROW AWAY THE SALT SOLUTION AND CONTAINER. Then follow the directions for calibrating the unit. Do the procedure all over again to make sure you calibrated it correctly. Repeat until the AcuRite reads 75% inside the sealed container with salt solution. It's a piece of cake.

The squirrels always seem to find a way to make a feast out of all the bird seed. I was hopeful with this feeder as it's setup meant that the dispensing slots closed with the weight of the squirrel. Unfortunately for the smaller birds, it also means that it closes when the larger birds come to feed. While that doesn't sound like a bad thing, it is if the smaller bird is already feeding as it can cause harm to the smaller bird if they don't move before the closing mechanism is activated by the larger bird.\n\nLike many other feeders, there is the issue of the squirrel chewing their way into the feeder. I thought the feeder was protected enough to avoid this issue, but I was wrong. I will say that it took them longer to chew their way through than with some of the other feeders that we've used.\n\nThe feeder itself is quite lovely to look at, and the idea behind it is good.

No power outages but to be ready I have:\n1. Tested it up to 1500 watts running (space heater). No problem.\n2. Tested it with my Samlex battery charger. This is an expensive 50 amp charger and so draws 500 watts max. In the ecomode the generator had no problems supplying that amount of power.\n\nI hope to run my furnace and sump pump off my deep cycle storage batteries with an inverter and so avoid having to run the generator all night or get out of bed at 2:00am during a hurricane to set up a generator. The issue is getting an inverter that can play nice with your house circuit wiring (bonded neutral), not simply running appliances directly plugged into it, which seems, so far, difficult for things like your furnace.\n\nI really should give this thing 5 stars but I am still bummed I can't get 240 volts to backfeed the house with two running in parallel. They should make that clear. My son in law is an electrical engineer, and he also assumed that could be done (He bought the Honda, and paid 2 1\/2 times what I did. \"What's the 2nd one for Dad? Spare parts?\" Bah. Snarky kids.).\n\n So, more accurate advertising, please.\n\nOh, about the noise. My original review stated they were noisier than I expected. It turned out I had the cover improperly attached (open at the base), and that defeated some of the insulation. With the case cover on properly, and in the ecomode, this is really not noisy at all.\n\nSo, one very pleased customer here.\n\n===================End of Update=======================\n\nBought two when they were on sale. This is my first generator. I was planning on hooking two together and backfeeding into the house. That cannot be done because they produce only 120 volts. A big bummer.\n\nHowever, they arrived promptly and are very nicely made machines. I have only run one machine for a short break in but here is my experience:\n\n1. Customer support: Good. I called about changing the sparkplug, since the manual doesn't discuss their new style of changing the plug via the opening on top of the case. Got a human who was very helpful without waiting.\n\n2. Filling the crank case is a nuisance. Pour the oil in slowly or it will back up. Put tinfoil under the oil filler opening on the floor, and put some paper towels on top of the tin foil to absorb the oil that spills. That will prevent a mess.\n\n3. Being an amateur, I spent most of my time fiddling with the grounding rod. (How do you make one of those?) I finally got it done. I used a green metal fence post from which I ground off the paint  to make it conductive. A big nuisance. Then I lost, in the snow, the set screw for the ground connector as I hammered the post into the frozen ground. Good thing I had bought two ground wire connectors. It is now buried in 2 feet of snow under a collapsed bush. I'll find it when I need or next spring. In retrospect, rebar wold work fine. Lowe's sells the ground wire connector, the wire, and the rebar.\n\n4. The generator started on the second pull in 24 degree weather. It powered a 1500 watt space heater without difficulty.\n\n5. It is light enough to be easily carried.\n\n6. It is a bit noisier than I was hoping for, but, not bad. Nowhere near the noise of other, albeit larger, generators.\n\nOther advice for amateurs. Be sure you have a gasoline siphon. I was surprised to find after the snow began, that my lawnmower gasoline cans were almost empty.","summary":"Nice generator but cannot backfeed into your house","unixReviewTime":1453507200,"style":{"Style:":" 2000 Watts"},"image":null}

My neighbors' trees drop tons of leaves on my lawn. Rather than blow them off before mowing, I just run right over the leaves. The mower sucks them right up, chops them, and spits them into the bag. It really saves garbage space to have the leaves chopped up.\n\nThe machine is really light, and the handle folds up.

It largely does what it is supposed to - reduces evaporation and heat loss (which is what keeps your pool warmer).  However, it won't last.  My cover is carefully reeled up during each swim session and placed in the shade.  About a year after owning it, I noticed some of the bubbles started popping and taking on water.  Then  a few months later, the cover started ripping every time we went to stretch it back over the pool.  I actually don't even reel it out lately unless I know we won't be swimming for a couple of days because it's so fragile.  I contacted Blue Wave about their five year warranty.

This \"lantern,\" when lit up, matches my outdoor decor of blue Mason Jars filled with tealights and isn't noticeable as a insect repellent.  Other fans I have seen in stores are brightly colored, unattractive, and have huge brand-names written across them.\nThe Cons:\n- Lantern is a misnomer.  This lantern barely lights up, more of a dull glow, but this may not be the worst thing in the world.  Light attracts bugs, the same thing the lantern is attempting to ward off.  It is strange, however, that the lantern has two settings.  One with the light and fan and a second setting for the light without the fan.  Given the minimal light, the second setting seems pointless. It would make more sense to have a fan with light option and a second option that has fan with no light.\n- Refills are, at this time, tough to find. Amazon sells them but they currently won't ship  for 2-4 weeks and the cost is insane compared to buying the lantern to begin with.  Refills, for those interested, can be found here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Stinger-Mosquito-Repellent-Refills-2-Pack\/dp\/B010FDL4I8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stinger Mosquito Repellent Refills (2 Pack)<\/a>\n\nThe Pros:\n- DEET Free!  No nasty chemicals here.\n- Comes with batteries (always a huge plus in our family)\n- A fairly quiet fan.  Nothing that guests will have to scream over.\n- It works and looks cute doing it.  Mosquitoes are the only insects that fly in this part of California at night (besides the benign moths).  It does a great job of keeping me bite free which is the only task I really expect it to do.","summary":"A cute, and functional, decoration...","unixReviewTime":1437091200,"style":null,"image":null}

The Nightguard seems to be keeping the deer out of my yard as last year my veggie garden, apple tree, and my wife's flower garden were untouched by the deer for a change. In the warm months I do also use a \"Scarecrow\" motion sensitive sprinkler as backup for the veggie garden coverage. Two years ago the deer ate green tomatoes, tomato and pepper plants, and string beans but last year nothing was touched\n\nAs suggested I have mounted 1 Nightguard on each side of a 3' high 2 by 2 for 360 degree coverage. I put a lag bolt with the head removed in the base so I can move them around the yard as advised by the manufacturer. Apparently the deer get used to them if left in the same spot. I have a game camera monitoring deer activity and have seen only two instances where they were close enough to be photographed but they were not in the yard. The game camera did also take a picture of the two theives as they snuck into my back yard but when the police got to where they had my nightguards they had fled the scene taking my nightguard stick with them.","summary":"Nightguard Predator Eyes","unixReviewTime":1369872000,"style":{"Format:":" Lawn & Patio"},"image":null}

It would have, too, so good move on my part.\nCome Christmas Eve, he got it and I was Queen of Christmas! He absolutely loved it!

The grate on it is a perfect size to do a few burgers or steaks. So, we broke it in with burgers, and we made baked potatoes down in the fire itself. Later on we made s'mores.

Lake effect snow storms are a pretty regular occurrence and ice storms happen more often than I would like. Our family likes to use products that are safe for animals and the environment so when we came across Nature Safe Ice Melt by Green Valley Earth Products we were eager to try it. Finally, bad weather made it's way to us and I had an opportunity to use this product. We had a small ice storm with travel advisories. There was a layer of ice on my front steps thick enough to be a hazard. I applied a generous amount of this product to the steps and waited for it to do it's job. It didn't work. The green pellets were fully intact on top of the ice. After the temperature increased significantly 2 days the ice began to melt. All the water laying against these pellets created a situation where people were tracking in green water on their shoes. I've had to mop several times to contain the problem. Once it did dry up enough outside I was able to sweep up the pellets and finally take care of the issue. A disappointing experience to be sure.\n\nI was provided this product at no cost to me in exchange for an honest unbiased evaluation.","summary":"***A Disappointing Experience To Be Sure***","unixReviewTime":1452124800,"style":null,"image":null}

I avoided this type of feeder in the store because it doesnt have a hook.  I have a metal shepherd hook attached to my deck railing but the hole on the feeder is too small, so now I have to guess what hook fits this feeder.  How hard could it be to add an S hook to the package?  I live nowhere near a hardware store.  Perky Pet has a 12 inch hook on Amazon but thats way too long in my opinion.  I need one thats 2 to 4 inches in length.\n\nOkay onto the product.  The flowers are a soft rubber material rather than hard, which I like a lot.  I always felt bad for the hummingbirds sticking their beaks into those hard plastic flowers which have no resemblance in feel to a regular flower at all, so these are better in that aspect.  I like the little perches in front of each flower because then the hummingbird will rest there while he drinks and you get a better chance to see him without his wings fluttering.  They are such marvelous little creatures to see up close.\nThe top is screw-on and you fill it from the top, which is another plus.  I have one thats bottom fill and its sometimes tricky getting it back together without spilling.\n\nThe body is hard plastic.  I prefer glass, but this is rather nice for plastic.  You can take the entire reservoir apart and clean it and the feeder has an ant moat on top but I wonder what would stop the ants from climbing up from the bottom.  I have a lot of ants yet none have tried to get in my other one.","summary":"Makes my hummingbirds happy","unixReviewTime":1410739200,"style":{"Color:":" Clear"},"image":null}

I rarely give poor reviews, because I try to research items as best I can before purchasing.  BARELY usable.  I'm a retired mechanical-technical-type, so I'll try to be precise.  Here's the two problems; one, it's true that they barely swivel, and once you tighten up one end the swivel is too tight to operate.  You wind up spinning your hose into this adapter instead of turning the swivel.  Second, the threads are not deep enough on one end.  Actually, the one end just isn't long enough.  Once you put the included washer in, the male end of your hose barely threads in two turns, and it leaks unless you use tools.  So this is why I rate it barely usable.  You will need a large wrench or pliers to tighten the one end, and as you tighten one end of course the other end unscrews.  So you really need two tools, one on each end of this adapter, to tighten it properly.  And then you need the tools to remove it.  I understand the need for it to tight at the swivel so it doesn't leak, but really?  They couldn't have made the swivel a little looser?  I even tried the thinner, red-colored \"soft\" rubber washers but they made no difference.  I put just the one in the \"shorter\" end.  The softer washer seem to bind the swivel even worse.  I consider this adapter a semi-permanent adapter not a casual one.  If I needed to use it more than once every few weeks I would send it back in a minute.  Aside from all this, it's solid brass and otherwise well-made.  It's just that it doesn't function as I think most people would think it's intended.","summary":"Barely Usable","unixReviewTime":1384905600,"style":null,"image":null}

We had plenty of weeds to pick today, so these garden gloves got a good workout. I am actually not used to wearing garden gloves (because I never had any good ones) - I usually would use non-latex disposable gloves. I have tried to use garden gloves before but they were much too large to fit my very small hands, so it didn't work out.\n\nFirst of all, if you have small hands, these will work! It helps that the part of the glove that goes over your wrist is a little long and tight but flexible around your wrist, because it keeps them in place really well. After hours of use, these gloves do not seem to be worn out at all. I have not had to wash them yet, and I will probably put them to the test and see how long I can go until they really seem like they need to be washed. I think that will also prolong their life.\n\nI am very pleased with these garden gloves. It was very simple for me to pick weeds with these. They have a good rubber grip on the palm side and a lightweight, comfortable material on the rest of the glove. These gloves are hypoallergenic, which is great because my skin is very sensitive. That was one of the things that drew me to purchase them.\n\nAlso, this package comes with 4 sets of gloves!! What a deal. I can't complain about that.\n\nReally happy with these gloves. Worth the money and would recommend and purchase again.\n\nUpdate 9\/1\/16: I washed these gloves for the first time in a delicates\/garment bag in the wash. Bad idea. One of the fingers came off like it was sliced off. To give these gloves credit, I should add that the garment bag was not the best one I have and has been known to come open in the wash. Moral of the story: hand wash only. I should have known this, but I guess I was just being lazy.","summary":"Perfect garden gloves for small hands and\/or sensitive skin!","unixReviewTime":1471651200,"style":null,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/811KO+mmc2L._SY88.jpg"]}

First, it looked as good erected on my as represented in the pictures shown on Amazon's site. If you live in Heaven, where there is no rain, no wind, and no beating sun, then the Regency Gazebo is for you.  Otherwise, keep shopping.  Save money and pay the price for a well made product. I feel the Regency II Gazebo is cheap, really cheap.  Let me count the ways. The fabric cover rotted out after only a couple of seasons. (Note this gazebo is my third or fourth over years of use.) The attachment points for the cover are pointed, if you can believe it, just aching to poke through their attachment pockets.  And these pockets are flimsy, unreinforced and lightly stitched. Flimsy!  The netting between the vent and the roof rotted off, again after only a couple of seasons' use.  The fabric cover quickly became bridle and faded. The steel frame is attractive but just as fragile as it looks. After only a short time, I had trouble keeping the gazebo square. Most of the time it looked like a drawing in a cartoon. And it is light. A few weeks ago a late santana (a seasonal high wind in the Los Angeles area) balled  the Regency up into a neighbor's tree. Yes, these winds are fierce, but keep in mind I have used one gazebo or another over the past fifteen or twenty years, and all of the Regency's predecessors, with some care, stood up under similar conditions. And, as other reviewers point out, it rusts - even in Southern California weather where rain is an event for celebration.  Yes it is powder coated, but that does not help at the weld points or, especially, where one part of the structure is inserted into another part. When I tried to dismantle the Regency after pulling it down from my neighbor's tree, I had trouble separating the various components due to rust.  I decided to buy the Regency II despite serious reservations after reading the reviews. My nervousness was not assuaged when I unpacked and erected it.  And my worst fears were confirmed when I looked out my kitchen window and saw it perched in my neighbor's tree.  The Regency irked me almost from day one.  Even before its mating with a tree, I had decided I would not waste my money on another flimsy replacement cover. My advice to you: If you want to use your gazebo for just one season, then the Regency II is for you.  Otherwise, pay the price for a good product.","summary":"The Regency II is as flimsy as it looks","unixReviewTime":1425340800,"style":{"Color:":" Brown"},"image":null}

I have a Weber, and the family really digs a smoked bird. I've used bricks, wrapped in foil, in the past, to split out the coals and cook meats and poultry indirectly, and that worked sort of OK, but these- THESE really do the job! The airflow is 100% better, and the heat is more even. How can that be, you ask? Well, if you're using bricks, they take a lot longer to heat up than you'd think, and they choke off some of the airflow to your briquettes- with rails, this doesn't happen, so the grill heats evenly, quickly, and it's much easier to control the speed of the burn. Having done turkeys, chickens (both whole, and spatchcocked), large roasts, and potatoes, I can tell you without any reservations that the rails are far superior to the brick method- plus, you have more room for a better drip pan in the bottom, and that makes for some fiiiiiine gravy! I bought these in the off-season (although, if you're a grilling fanatic, there IS NO off-season for BBQ!), so I got a great price- but I would pay more, knowing now how well they work. These are a must-have, if you're even semi-serious about your BBQ, and indirect-grilling or hot-smoking meats. :)","summary":"Just what I was looking for!","unixReviewTime":1394064000,"style":null,"image":null}

A heavy duty cord will not go through the slot for the cord holder, but I just use the old method of tying a knot in the line where it connects to the cord from the unit and that takes the strain off of the electric cord.

It is a bugger to get that top off the tank for cleaning - super duper tight.  It's powered off 4 D size batteries - use alkaline as they are 1.5 volt - if you try rechargeable they are only 1.2 volt - 4 batteries you'd lose 1.2 volts before you got started. The unit will spray down for weeds and across for shrubs reasonably fair, but not up like you could with a pump sprayer.  The spray on\/off is by a switch on the unit rather than handle so it is difficult to spot spray weeds with. The wand, nozzle and everything abt the unit is plastic. The unit is abt 4 lbs w\/batteries and water is a tad over 8 lbs, so you tote abt 12 lbs.  I think this unit will probably do the weed killing spray job for the summer.

Before I reinforced it - 2 or 3 of the pieces came looose.. so it isn't super well constructed - I think it would have done fine if I had, had it on the ground, but I am hanging them. They are worth reinforcing. They are pretty and unique and I have a Japanese garden with a pond and tons of bamboo and I am picky, but they look great. To reinforce - I used zip Ties in several places and double zipped so they basically cant fall apart in core areas. Then when I mounted them - I used U screws (for coax cable management). So it secured the Willow against the wall - again in strategic locations. This may sound like a lot, but it was really no big deal. Took like 15 mins each trellis? Worth it for the Willow look. Its unique and the item is priced right. Zip ties and cable management U screws were an additional $7 maybe. I do have 1 issue - I ordered 1, loved it so ordered 2 more.. then I had space on the wall for 1 more so I got a 4th and it came In a different color and thickness. Still beautiful - but wasn't uniform. Totally okay because its a trelllis and should be covered by plants - but when I went to order the next one I wasn't 100% sure what I would get. However - if I hadnt ordered the others, I would never have known the difference and would have been happy.","summary":"Beautiful- needs to be reinforced if hanging, but worth it","unixReviewTime":1531008000,"style":{"Size:":" 1-Pack","Item Package Quantity:":" 1","Package Quantity:":" 1"},"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71o2dTULSNL._SY88.jpg"]}

We plan to get the additional sensor, but just thought the product name was a little misleading if you didn't take time to really read the features (I just skimmed..).  We double checked the accuracy, and what it is reporting, is what the actual temperature is (we used another thermometer to check). Thanks!\n\nUpdate: Dropping to 2 stars. The temperature  sensor that goes into the pool, has already fogged over and we can no longer read the temperature of the pool.

We received the first two and were pleasantly surprised at the quality. Amazon Prime had a special price on these and we bought at the right time (around $33\/ea.). The other two arrived several days later (temporarily out of stock). The material is definitely made for either use, but I lean toward these being mostly for outdoor use.  The texture is definitely like other outdoor cushions that will resist water, but will not be completely waterproof.\n\nUsed in an aluminum dining outdoor set, they replaced seat cushions that were 19\" x 20\". With the backs, these things over-stuff the chairs, so actually a little give will be welcome. They extend out past the seat frame, but line up perfectly with the backs of the chairs and the ties are in the right spot. Still, I wanted something over-sized so that as time wore on, the cushions would still feel rich, classy and not disappear in the chair frame. These definitely do the trick. Also, we didn't have any problems with the tag removal at the top of the back section. After clipping in between seams, leaving only a very thin piece of the label, we mushed the cushion into itself and the back cushion basically absorbed the rest of the label, never to be seen again.\n\nI would recommend these, and at the price we paid, they are well worth it. Stitching is absolutely great, sturdy construction, and the cushions are filled firmly to last for some time.

The unit is heavy duty and well constructed, a bit heavy, but you can roll it where needed. One issue I had, sometimes, when I placed the wheel to start trimming it was turned in the wrong position and hard to get moving. Once moving it rolled decently. Trimming a larger area where you need to go back and forth, you need to hold your trimmer handle to guide it. This is fine, but for me with a bad back it causes some discomfort. The seller shows using the unit with a handlebar (not included) which I think would help in guiding the trimmer and reduce bending over which can cause back pain.\n\nThe big wheel on this unit is a good idea which aids in moving over lawn imperfections. Having two wheels as some have suggested, would would reduce maneuverability of the unit. The spring loaded shaft worked well for bumping my trimmer and advancing the line. Also, the angle adjustment nut which is also spring loaded is convenient.","summary":"A Decent Trimmer Guide","unixReviewTime":1493251200,"style":null,"image":null}

I was a little disappointed to see features not included that others do such as the ability to daisy chain. Not something ive ever had to make sure was an option before. Very disheartening.\n\nThe light states the lumens on height, but I would argue that the led (or at least mine) must be a bit closer to achieve similar results.\n\nFor a 600w light, I would expect a larger area of coverage.\n\nNow then, the light itself is pretty good. Wide spectrum, low draw. After adjustments from the above qualms, plants are drinking it in. I have them about 30 inches above my plants without bleaching or any adverse effects. No idea if this is a good or bad thing since my 300 w will bleach the hell out of anything that close. Maybe the lenses are different.\n\nI will most likely switch this to clones and find something with more bang like a cob with a daisy chain. Still can't believe there are lights made without a daisy chain option. These are lights for growing, not lighting up a room like a light bulb.\n\nUpdate: my opinion on this light hasn't changed much, but I do like the reliability of the leds. Ive not had any go out on me yet and its been in use 18 hours a day so far. For the price of the unit, if daisy chaining the lights together isn't on your agenda, I would whole recommend this light. It has enough light for 4 or so smaller plants. If you plant on growing something large, you'll need supplemental lighting for the under canopy.\n\nEDIT: A year later and the light is still going.

Propane is a refrigerant (a refer that explodes), and like all refrigerants its pressure is dependent on its temperature through almost all conditions (technical:  as long as there is a bit of liquid refrigerant in the tank, the refrigerant occupies the flat area on the P\/T curve).  As a result, you'll always \"read green\" on the gauge until it almost exhausts the tank (= vaporize the last of the liquid).  If you watch the gauge while cooking (a real trick), you'll see the needle drop in the last 5--10 minutes, but of course at this point you have food in mid-cook.  Watching the size of the flame jets is just as effective in getting a lead time (no jet = no gas!!).  I tried this gauge twice (I'm such a glutton for punishment), and both times when I changed tanks (after a \"surprise outage\" in the middle of a cook) the gauge then refused to pass gas; I surmise the tank change operation introduced a spec of dust (twice) that blocked an internal port.  When you're cooking (and the shrimps on the barbie are making fun of you), you're not going to sit down and clean out the ports (if they can be cleaned; at $13 I'm not investing anymore time).  Fortunately, these gauges are as easy to take out as they are to install, so the shrimps lost the game after all.  However:  \"never again\".  On the bright side:  we have Recycling here, so some lucky sorting facility gets some brass!!  I love happy endings.","summary":"No value","unixReviewTime":1380585600,"style":{"Color:":" QCC1"},"image":null}

It was cutting through 6 inch branches like butter.  The saw seems well made and am very happy with it overall.\n\nCons - The bolt that holds the cover and chain tensioner down stripped out the first time I tried to tighten it down.  I normally tighten my chainsaw bar bolts extremely tight but didn't put nearly the amount on this saw.  It was an easy fix to re-tap the hole and put a new bolt in but I assume most people don't have these tools to do so.\n\nThe saw can get heavy when you have it extended to its max.  I am a fairly rugged guy and after an hour of using it, my arms were tired.  This is expected as the majority of the saws weight is at the cutting end.\n\nOverall I am very happy with this purchase, especially for the price.

In my case working on a film set, on location. It always happens that we will be out in the middle of nowhere, and everyone has devices they must use that eventually run out of energy. Having this handy, with the ability to charge it with a solar panel is exceptionally valuable in those situations. Using this, I can keep my laptop charged and in use for over 24 hours when needed, and a cell phone even longer!\n\nDevices seem to charge as fast from the battery as they do from the wall. I love that there is the LCD screen that shows how much energy is remaining in the battery. The entire kit is very user friendly.\n\nAlso great for long car trips. You can charge it in the car, and then recharge devices as they die along the way. Particularly useful when you have a bunch of kids in the car that will lose their marbles if their tablet stops working.\n\nMost importantly though, this is an invaluable item to keep in a home safety kit. When the power goes out or there is an emergency, this battery is portable, reliable and charges in many different ways. This can turn a bad situation around. We lose power after storms and sometimes it can be out for as much as a week. Having the ability to plug in a lamp or a toaster, that makes life livable in an outage.\n\nSome things to note- The Sherpa does not come with any sort of a storage pouch. It is very vulnerable to damage from liquid spills, so if you intend to port it around, I would invest in a waterproof container of some sort. The solar panel does have a mesh pouch which holds all the cord that come with this kit, but again, it isn't waterproof.\n\nThere is a metal wire on the top of the battery pack that you can use to attach a lock to keep people from walking off with your power source. This is a great feature for using away from home.\n\nOn the back there is a door you can unscrew to gain access to the fuse. There is an indicator on the small lcd screen when the fuse fails and it is easy to replace.\n\nThere is not a laptop charging adaptor made by goal zero for apple computers, but I was able to plug my apple charging cord directly into the ac outlet on the inverter and charge the laptop that way.\n\nThere is a 6 month warranty with the product.","summary":"Exceptionally useful in many situations.

Problem is, they have gotten so junky as of late, that the metal ones leak horribly too. Having worked with a lot of indoor PEX plumbing lately, I've dealt with some indoor plumbing fittings called 'Sharkbites', that are expensive, but wonderful about no-leaks, and durable. I thought, 'man, that would be great to find something like those for hosepipe'. Well, they aren't metal, but these Nelson fittings are 'sharkbites' for hosepipe. They have fingers inside that bite and grip the hose, and the clamp down is solid and secure. I have three of them in operation, one is often under pressures approaching 70-psi, and it has held up for a year with no problems and constant pressure. I am a believer! Not a single drop of water leaked since I started using them. I can't say enough good about them. Once you cut and square your old hose pipe end with a knife or cutoff tool, you don't need tools to put these on, they just press-on, and hand tighten down, right there. No clamping, no wrenches, no screwdrivers, you just tighten them and you are like new again. You can get Male, Female and hose-to-hose joints.

The fabric is not exceptionally sturdy, but will probably last two or three seasons in the sun (granted, i live in a mild, coastal climate). This is a sewn plastic cover that fits your two extended side-arm-shaped grill. The bottom skirt has two sets of ties (you need to manually tie the two ends together) to go around two of your grill legs, and one pull cord that slightly tightens the circumference of the bottom of the skirt (see pics). I say slightly tightens, because the pull cord only comes out one side, and so it is not easy to tighten the skirt all the way around- you have to pull really hard. There is also a triangle vent on each side (see pic of my fingers showing through some of the holes on the inside) covered by outer plastic on two of the three triangle edges, so no water can get in.\n\nBtw, the pouch the cover comes in, is actually sewn to the inner top of the cover, so it will be laying on top of your grill on the inside.  it's a bit weird, and causes a slight bump on the grill (but u can move it to the back, kinda). I guess this feature would be great if you plan to use the pouch to store your cover again, since this way you can't lose it, but this feature has limited use for me, since i don't tend to pack up my grill cover- i just set it on the side until the BBQ cools, and i put it back on the grill. i can't see folding it up and taking it with me anywhere w that handle, etc...\n\nIt's sewn well, overall, considering it's a single stitch construction without a waterproofing underseam like some tents have. so i can't speak to the waterproofing of the seams at this point, and it does not look like it would leak much, if at all under normal rainy conditions, but it might not be absolutely water tight at the seams if there was a deluge. Overall, the price is a tad high for this item, and i prefer the thicker fabric-type covers that are about about $5 more expensive.  One i've used for the past three years and is still holding up great and feels much more substantial, is the Classic Accessories 73902 Veranda Small Grill Cover For Weber Q-300 & Q-320 Grills--http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B007XAKFRI?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage.\n\nStill, this  green grill slicker is pleasant looking, and about 1\/2 the weight of fabric covers, so that does have it's uses.

It is a metal shed [about 2000 Sq Ft] with only 1 small window. Perfect place for bats to shack up. I have a motion sensor alarm that alerts my house if ANY intruder moves & after no false alarms for 5 years suddenly it became obvious that bats had moved in. MANY people have bats without knowing it. Bats are almost helpless if anything interupts their sonar sound system & this unit stopped my false alarms almost instantly. After I saw how nice it worked I moved it under my house that I live in. Most houses in Kentucky have no basement but a crawl space to sevice plumbing,wiring ect. My crawl space is about 3-4 feet tall with plastic on the ground neat & clean. Suddenly had some rodent move in [maybe a squirrel] that started tearing up some insulation. After no success in trapping it I went to my shed & got my ET pest unit & the varmint moved out as suddenly as it had come in. This unit is so versital in repelling so MANY different kind of pests & uses NO harmful chemicals or poisons. I am ordering more of these units to put under my other rental houses because it is trouble free,not noticable,works 24-7 & I calculate electric cost at about 25 cents per month. To control almost all pests just set the pitch to \"Variable\" & it will drive em all out with it`s inconspicuous squalling sounds. It has a test button you can push to hear the sound at YOUR ear level & that will convince you that it will drive the pests crazy when they hear it at THEIR ear level. Nice product,easy & clean to use & a whole lot cheaper than an exterminator. Trapping gets only the dumb ones.

When I'm trying for a more 'tilled' effect, I use a hoe with tines, but today I wanted to expose ground covered with weeds so I could hack into it with a pickaxe in order to plant a shrub.  Having the right tool for the job really makes a difference.  It was hot today and being able to finish the whole job in 15 minutes couldn't have been better.\n\nShould this hoe ever break, which it shows no sign of doing, I'm glad I can replace it through Amazon.

The initial disappointment was due to the size, which was smaller than expected, though that does have its advantages as well.\n\nNow the frustration is poor performance.  First it takes a bit of effort, the seeds need to be watered three times a day for best results.  This might not be a thing if I didn't have a job, but I do, so I am limited to twice a day effectively, and if life gets busy less.  That may be related to the next problem which is rot.  The sprouts I have been trying to grow seem to be rotting before they reach maturity. I have had some good batches, but my wife is getting upset at the smell from the not so good batches.\n\nFinally I have had an issue with the drainage from tray to tray being plugged by the roots of some of the sprouts which leads back to the more maintenance problem.\n\nThat all said, the only reason I have not given it 1 star is that I have been using a different blend of seeds that may be to blame.

Then they have prepared seed pods that you place into the holes in the base - and each seed pod gets a little plastic see-through cover snapped on top to keep things humid\/moist until the seeds sprout.  Press the button and you hear an aeration pump turn on - and the sunlight bulb.  (There's a special timer built in that will cycle the bulb off at the appropriate time.)\n\nEasy (pictures!) directions.  And a supporting website.  And - just Google the product and Tips\/Tricks - you'll see some great ideas and reviews.\n\nUpdate - it's just a few days after Christmas, and I see our little seedlings starting to peek out of the seed packs.

Before they \"new improved\" software was release, I could go all the way back to when I first setup the weather station.  Now if I want to review what the temps were three months ago, I have to go to weather.com or some other place that keeps records.\n\nJan 2016. I got my weather station for Christmas, and set it up that day.  I have always wanted to be able to look at what the temp was earlier in the day or over night, now I can.  I can look at charts of the different weather trackers.  One of the really cool features is the temp sensor has a solar powered fan to bring in outside air so you get a more accurate reading.  I have a regular sensor that feed a different temp display when the sun is on the east side of the house it is sunlight, and always showed a much higher temp then the one on the AcuRite (at night they show the same temp).\n\nAfter about a month of use the solar fan stopped working.  I called tech support, they asked a few questions, and then sent out a replacement solar panel\/fan unit.  Quick and easy.  Thank you.\n\nUPDATE June 2016. It is now mid June, six months after first installing my weather station.  Once again the solar powered fan has gone out.  What this means that with the sun shinning on the unit it shows temperature of 100 degrees.  Other temp sensors I have that are in shade show a temp of 91.  Minor problem, but still have to get a replacement and install it.  Again\n\nSEPTEMBER 20, 2016. Acurite has changed it's app for the WORST.  I have not been able to upload my past data.

I must say it cooks really nice! I a novice at this grilling\/cooking stuff but I really enjoyed grilling steaks on this tonight. The charcoal Chimney I got made starting coals really easy. I'm normally the one wadding up news paper (about 20 sheets) to start my coals. But the chimney was impressive. But that's another review.\nI originally purchased the smokey joe portable grill. But after reading the reviews, and rethinking the point that other reviews made about this grill. I returned the Smokey Joe and purchased this go-anywhere grill.\n\nI like the fact that this grill is rectangular shaped rather than the round. I just feel that the coals are spread out better with this design. The heat is even from corner to corner.\nThe fact that the food sits closer to the coals is a big plus! With a nice bed of hot coals I cooked a 1.5\" steak 4 minutes with the cover on and the vents fully open, then 1 minute with the cover off to seer the steak and give it a nice char. (did this on both sides) The steak was a perfect medium rare!\nI also like that when done, if you close all the vents the grill cools down really fast.\n\nI would highly recommend this grill to anyone who needs a good portable grill.\n\nOh? Some of the other reviews talk about the side vents being stainless steel?? They look like they could pass for stainless, but they are actually aluminum. Just FYI.\n\nUpdate:\nI've had this grill for over a year. The grills inside are fairly rusted but that's to be expected since the grill is left outside 24\/7. But this is still my favorite grill to cook on!  Weber just got this design right! Food comes out perfect every time! It's portable size and great grill area is a must have for any tailgater!

This happened about a month ago so I tried putting some Moletox in the gopher tunnel and gopher mounds quit showing up. I wasn't sure if the gopher died or just moved to a different area. Another too smart to be trapped gopher showed up last week so I opened up the tunnel by the gopher mound, put some Moletox back in the tunnel as far as I could with a small hand shovel and then just to be sure I set the trap a little closer to the opening than the Moletox.

Unroll it in the sun, weigh the ends down and in 5 minutes on a good day it will lose the \"memory\" of being shipped rolled up.  The rest is cake - really, really easy.\n\nEasy to use, easy to set up - the only reason it doesn't get more stars from me is that I've got a lot of critters in my neighborhood - squirrels, chipmunks, rabbits, skunks, groundhogs, deer, raccoons - and a couple of the more enterprising among them have chewed some holes in the outside.\n\nNot huge ones, mind you, but enough that I quickly went to the Home Depot and got some 3'x25' 1\/2\" wire mesh, snipped and surrounded the still 99% intact unit.  Problem solved.\n\nThe fact is, I should have thought to do this first - I've seen what they did to my poor bird feeder, even to the airtight feed storage box, so part of the blame is on me.  What should I have expected when I kept putting delicious raw and cooked veggie scraps, old bread and other delectable items in a bin on the far side of my property, abutting a forest?  It may as well have been a written invitation.\n\nNext year, I'll just remove the plastic and leave the wire mesh, but for a beginning composter, this is an easy, affordable solution that works WAY faster than even my new rotating composter.\n\nBut if you've got a set of wire snips, some fine mesh (1\/2\" is best) chicken wire, and a few 3.5' poles to thread through the holes, you can make one of these yourself.  If you don't ,you'll spend more money than this costs to do it from scratch, but not a world more.  And you'll have some chicken wire left over for parties and holiday dinners.","summary":"Pros, cons - a good product but depends on your situation","unixReviewTime":1403481600,"style":null,"image":null}

As other reviews noted, it will take about about an hour to break everything down, take all the packing paper off, get it all out of the boxes THEN you can start to actually construct it.\n\nGood news - while the paper is all taped around the chair's metal frames, it is easily ripped masking tape. So it wasn't difficult to get the packing paper off, just time consuming. And that's a good thing! The set should arrive without any dings or damage.\n\nThe fire pit comes assembled. It is a TWO person job to move it, and it it's in top box. So expect to need two people to do all this.\n\nThe chairs are easy to assemble with two people AND a socket wrench set. I tried to use the included wrench, but that would have taken forever! But using a socket wrench took maybe two minutes a chair - very easy. Again - two person job. I wouldn't even try to do it myself. The chairs are not light, and to line up and then screw in the bolts is not worth the hassle of doing it yourself. And to repeat - use a socket wrench.\n\nYou are going to be left with an enormous amount of packing material - again, not a bad thing. Just make some space before it all arrives so you don't huge cardboard boxes getting in your way after the fact.\n\nQUALITY - this is really the most important thing anyway, and on this score, this set seems worth the money and very well-made.\n\nThe chairs are metal with welded slats to enable the rocking. While the metal is light, it's still heavy-duty enough to hold up against the sun and the rain (I hope, anyway). The rocking motion is nice and i think a neat switch from a standard unmoving chair.\n\nThe cushions are thick fabric - and you're going to pay at least $50 for a similar cushion anywhere I've seen. Maybe more, since this is a two cushion set. Again, the fabric seems good quality and should hold up.\n\nIf you paid $225 for the chair\/cushion, you'd be looking at $900 for the set and I don't think that's unreasonable. Expensive, but not unreasonable or unexpected. The cushions would probably be included.\n\nThe fire pit is solid, and while I don't love the design on the sides, it's okay and you won't notice it that much. The pit itself is not that high and a few chairs around the edge will fill it in quite nicely. It certainly would cost $400 by itself - probably more. And with the chairs, that puts this at a fair price of $1300, which is what it's currently listed at.\n\nAs for the fire pit performance, I haven't used it yet, but I'll update that part of it later. I wanted to do all this now while it was fresh in my head! It's not like you'll be cooking on the flame, anyway. It's mostly for the ambience.\n\nSIZE - I have a 20x11 deck, and that is the minimum amount of space you need - assuming you already have other deck furniture. I already had a table, a few chairs and a chaisse lounge. Obviously, these chairs replaced a few others - but even then, the space got filled quick. Ideally, you'd have a 20x16 space, and I think that would be perfect.\n\nThe chairs rock, so you can't push them up against a fence or railing - not a negative, just be aware. They take up space but they are big and comfortable. They are deep cushioned, so you'll end up sitting back from the table a little bit.\n\nThe fire pit measures 38x38, but again - it's more than that. You need space for the chairs to have space, and it's going to take up a lot, quick. So if you ALREADY have a table\/umbrella like most decks do, be aware of all that.\n\nNone of this is a bad thing, and most buyers probably have a lot more space than me and it won't even be an issue.\n\nTo sum up - good quality that feels high-end and well-made. They're charging high-end price and they are delivering a product that seems to deserve it. The cushions and the rocking chair are fun. The fire pit ledge gives a good space to put drinks, but I don't think I'd try to use it as an eating surface.\n\nIt doesn't come with a cover, and I would get one. I don't like the idea of rainwater getting underneath the rocks...although since it doesn't have a base, the water won't collect in anything. Still, I would get a cover.\n\nAt $1300, it's pricey, but I think you'll get what you're paying for - I like these chairs, and the pit is a neat addition to the deck ambiance. I will update this review as I see the quality prove itself over the sun and rain of the summer months.","summary":"By early impressions, well-made and rugged set","unixReviewTime":1401494400,"style":{"Size:":" 1","Color:":" Sand\/Metallic"},"image":null}

Comes with 3\/8 inch QC couplings, male on one end and female on the other.  Includes the o-ring, and it is installed on the female coupling.  Also has bend guards on each end, as shown in the picture.\n\nNote, this is for higher-pressure machines.  This will not work out the box for mid- and lower-pressure machines, such as most every electric washer and most every 2500-3400psi gas washer.  It is not the products fault if you order the wrong hose\/connectors.  You should order this if your setup uses 3\/8 inch QC couplings, such as you would find in most every machine above 3500 or so psi.  Check your machines specs first before ordering.  This will not work out the box with 1\/4 inch or 5\/16 inch hose setups, unless you change the connectors on this or your system.\n\nThe hose itself is rated 4500psi.  My machine can do 4200psi\/4.0gpm.  Always, always, always, lower the pressure on your machine when testing new hoses.  If the hose bursts or a connector comes undone, this can be a very dangerous situation.  Start low and check the entire length of the hose.  Gradually increase pressure and re-check the hose.  Keep raising it until you reach your desired working pressure and re-check the hose.  Use it for a short while and re-check the hose.  Really, you should be doing this every time you use your machine, and not just when the hose is new.  Its smart and safe.\n\nThe hoses themselves are high-quality, but I would not say pro quality.  These hoses are too flexible for day-to-day use and abuse.  These are the kind that will easily kink and ruin themselves if you are not careful.  Don't get me wrong.  I am not calling them cheap.  They are good hoses.  However, compared to other comparably-priced pro-level hoses I have had in the past, these are not the best.  As long as you can keep them from kinking, they should be fine for many years.\n\nAs for corrosion in the braiding.  First of all, make sure to roll up your hoses in such as way as to allow the water to drain out completely.  It takes practice, but you can get most of that water out.  Also realize that all hoses have this \"problem.\"  Its just that you usually cannot see the braid.  These are translucent, and that's why now all of a sudden you can see it.  If this is really a problem for you, I would recommend you leave the pressure washing thing to the pro's.  Really, this is not a problem in itself.  Its normal.  Bubbling hoses are bad.  Rusted braid, eh, not a big deal.\n\nI was able to use two of these plus the OEM 50 footer, for a total of 150 feet with my machine no problem.  Still had great pressure at the tip.  If you need a long reach, just buy more 50 footers.  Do not waste your time, effort and money with 100 footers.  50 footers are better in every way except price.  Well, price at least in the short term.  In the long run, 50 footers are cheaper.  Also, 50 footers allow for easily customized setups.  If you only need 50, then only use 50.  Add more as needed.  Also, if one bursts, its not the end of the show if you get my meaning.  When a 100 footer bursts, it hurts your feelings.  Also, 50 footers are easier to clean up at the end of the day.  I did this as a business for many years.  Trust me, stay away from the 100 footers.","summary":"Great hose, though not quite pro quality","unixReviewTime":1474243200,"style":{"Size:":" 50-Foot"},"image":null}

I was able to unpacked it mostly by myself and made sure each part I needed was there, per the instructions. My drum was was not dented, and I only had one small scratch on the red top (about 1\/2 to 3\/4 inch long on the right side of the lower portion of the top). Given that the unit weighs over 120 lbs., and has to go through many different shippers to get to its final destination, I am very satisfied with the physical condition of my smoker. While I unpacked most of it myself, putting it together was different, and I did require my brother's assistance (well, mostly I assisted him) when it came time to assemble the smoker\/grill. It took us about 45 minutes to get everything in working order.\n\nWe followed the instructions very carefully as far as using the smoker\/grill for the first time, and I would recommend everyone do so (even if you are familiar with other smokers). Be aware, even after loading the unit with the pellets and getting everything ready to go, you need to run the grill for a good 45 minutes on 350 degrees without food in it, in order to season the grill. (So I suggest you attempt the assembly and the initial set-up on less than an empty stomach, because it does take some time.) Then, once the grill has cooled, you need to coat the grates with vegetable oil and allow them to cook on a low degree setting for 2 hours, and then cool the grates again, before using. (All of this is in the instruction manual, and I suggest you read the entire manual before starting.) Once that was done and the grate was completely seasoned, we cooked some of the best rib-eye steaks I have ever had.\n\nThe next day we cooked some marinated chicken pieces. Fantastic! We have basically used the grill function, but next weekend we are going to do some ribs, low and slow, and I can hardly wait. I can only review a product based on my own personal experience. And, for me, this MoJack 47101 Myron Mixon Pitmaster Q3 Grill\/Smoker definitely deserves 5 stars, and I highly recommend it. I would definitely purchase one as a gift for a friend or a relative.

I am not currently using it as a hose holder.  The description for this product states that it can hold a 125' long hose.  I have a 100' long hose, but it would be way to much work to coil it back up in this container.  So I am using it to store a lot of my gardening supplies - tools, sprays, grass seed, etc.  It is a very light weight container, so trying to use it with such a long and heavy hose could be a struggle.\nThe stamped, textural design on this container looks great.  It is a dark green, almost copper patina look with different colors of paint used.  I have not had any issues w\/ rusting.  I live in South Texas, where we get a lot of morning dew, but not usually a lot of rain.  It's definitely not Seattle!  There are drainage holes at the bottom of the container, plus the three hex-head type screws that secure the center post for keeping the hose reeled neatly.  I removed the center post and put the three screws back in to keep those holes covered.  Where I live I could encounter some nasty critters, might as well keep that chance to a minimum.\nI recommend purchasing the lid, which is sold on Amazon separately.

The charger is substantial, is the battery, but it's easy to use and turns off when charging is complete.\n\nThere is a toggle on\/off switch that gives a beep to announce that it worked (the trigger is ready to be pulled). It remains on, until switched off (or until the battery is dead or removed).\n\nThere is a 2-3 second delay after pulling the trigger. This is somewhat annoying, but it has a variable-speed trigger, so it's possible to just slow down the flow at times, rather than let go completely. It's so powerful, that maybe the idea is to act as a sort of safety switch, so only a deliberate press sets it off. I would like it better without the delay before starting each time when pulling the trigger.\n\nIt's been maintenance-free and easy to use and charge. The battery pops in and out with ease, and slides into its charger intuitively. It has some heft, the main weight of the unit, but the quantity of wind makes clearing the driveway 3x faster than with our previous battery-powered units, and just as fast or faster than our gas-powered one.","summary":"Fast and Light","unixReviewTime":1441670400,"style":{"Style:":" w\/ battery and charger"},"image":null}

There are a lot of different fly swatters out there, but this one seemed to have more features than all others.\n\n-This one is rechargeable using your normal ac wall outlet. Others I have used always took those two heavy D batteries which once dead are expensive to replace. When the power winds down, I just need to unscrew the base and pop it into an outlet. (You should charge these four hours before you use and pop it in for recharge once every 30-60days when not using to keep your battery in the best shape.)\n\n-Nice and powerful at 3,000volts.\n\n-The base which you can unscrew has a built in flash light.\n\n-There is also a led light to illuminate the metal mesh end of the swatter and draw the prey in!\n\n-Has a ZAP button to press when you go to swat.\n\n-Well-built and does not feel flimsy at all.\n\n-If you are wondering, yes I have zapped myself to feel how strong the zap is and yes, it is a nice strong zap. We want to use this in our garden out back soon as that seems to be a meeting place for all the mosquitos and flying bugs in our neighborhood. Not sure why, but there is a great pleasure when you swing, see a little spark and hear the bbzzzzt! I know this is not a toy, but it certainly gives me a lot of fun and enjoyment using.\n\nCons  I have to reduce by 5 star rating down to 3 as there is a problem with my power button on the handle. (See video.) Something must be loose as it flickers and goes on and off when you touch the switch. If I mess with it, it does work though. But certainly something is not right. If the seller reads this and offers an exchange, I can update this review accordingly as if it would not be for the issue with the switch, this is certainly a 5 star item.\n\nI don't know about you, but I depend very heavily on reviews that are posted on Amazon. I also read what reviewers on Amazon have to say. I want to help others by providing my reviews that detail the product as well as the experience I have with the products that I get on Amazon.\n\nPlease note I have no relationship with this seller and Im not compensated in any way for my review. I did receive this at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.  I take my reviews serious and will only provide my true feedback.

The only problem I've had with it was that I let grease get on the oven temp probe and it caught on fire and stopped working.  I bought a new one from Maverick for $12 shipped and was back in business.  It was my fault it died since once the hamburger grease got on it I should have taken it off the grill and wiped it clean, but I didn't do that so I bear the responsibility.\n\nThis thing gets great reception between the remote unit and the base. I can go 200' easy and still get a good signal. The only negative I've found in this unit is that it is a big pain to set the temperature limits as you can only go one direction when scrolling to a new temp.  So say you have your max temperature alarm set to 195 and you want to move it to 190, you have to scroll upwards from 195 to the max temp setting where it will then start over at the bottom setting and start scrolling up from there.  If you go past your stopping point you are out of luck.\n\nHowever, other than that minor problem, the unit has been rock solid and I use it every time I use my keg grill.\n\nUPDATE: 5\/15\/2012 - I've owned the ET 732 for almost a year and a half and *when it works* it is awesome.  The caveat is that the probes just don't last.  I've already had to replace the food probe (was $12 shipped from Maverick) and now the original oven temp probe and the replacement food probe have both failed (the ET 732 reads HHH whenever either is inserted). I guess if you don't mind paying $24 each and every year to replace both probes, and my pricing data may be out of date, then this is a great thermometer. It is my understanding that the new replacement probes are longer at 6' but weren't redesigned to make them more durable.  I did not treat mine harshly and never got them wet however my Big Steel Keg, like many cookers of its type, is known for retaining moisture in the cooking chamber so perhaps that is what is killing my probes.  Frankly based on reading the large number of 1 star reviews with the same exact problem I doubt it though.","summary":"Work(ed) great with my Big Steel Keg","unixReviewTime":1313971200,"style":{"Color:":" White"},"image":null}

Boy, what a disapointment! The only thing easier was to plop the wet sponges into the little pots. Well, it's actually just as simple to fill a pot with some dirt and add the seeds. Reading the instructions that were enclosed with the Chia Herb Garden were actually more involved than growing my herbs the regular way. Also, most of the seeds that came with it were either way their expiration date or just didn't take. I got a few spindly seedlings? even after keeping the sponges wet and covering them with plastic bags, as instructed.

Instead I mounted this emitter on a 90-degree elbow and set it flush with the yard. Works perfectly and is unobtrusive when not being used.\n\nOnly downside that I can see is that right after install, if you have any good rains you're likely going to get a little bit of erosion around the base of the emitter if it's installed on a soft\/dirt surface. This isn't a design flaw, just something to be aware of. So over time, as your grass grows back in, you'll probably have to add some dirt around this device to get it back flush with the surrounding surfaces.

It is supposed to be a one-way valve.  The way you empty the gas can when inverted is to engage the hook on the side of the spout on the edge of your gas tank (lawnmower tank, snowblower tank, whatever) and then depress down (i.e. actually push down on the entire can, pressing it towards the ground with the 85053 cradled in your hands).  This compresses the spring-loaded spout and opens the one-way valve so the gas is allowed to empty out the spout and into your lawnmower (like depressing the nozzle on an aerosol can so something can come out).  Sounds good, right?\n\nWell, there are several problems.  First of all, the tip of the spout has to extend fairly deeply into the tank of your lawnmower to enable you to engage the hook on the side of the spout to activate that whole spring-loaded compression process.  You really can't see the gas emptying out the end because it is already buried in gasoline in your shallow lawnmower tank.  Secondly, I found the whole process rather clumsy because the gas can handle is on top (perfect for carrying it away from the gas station) but you have to invert the tank virtually 180 degrees to position it to make this spring-loaded spout process work.  It is just clumsy trying the hold the inverted can, especially if full and heavy, without the assistance of any handles since the handle is now underneath the can in that position.\n\nBut, worst of all, when I depress the spout on my can, the gas does not just come out the end of the spout like it is supposed to.  It comes out everywhere.  There is a flood of gasoline that spews out from who knows where, through seals that are supposed to keep the gas from leaking out presumably.  I tried everything I could to fix it.  It was not an issue of the spout being improperly tightened down into the can.  The gas just gushed out through the side of the spout everytime the spring-loaded mechanism was depressed.  That is why my Briggs & Stratton 85053 is worthless.  I mean that literally.  It is unusable.  You just end up with a mess on the ground as maybe two-thirds of the gasoline makes it into the tank, and the rest of it is on your lawnmower deck, your shoes, and ground.\n\nI now see as I post this review that I am not the only one who has had this problem.  For some people, it evidently works fine.  For me, I may has well have just burned a $20 bill.  It was wasted money.  My efforts at better environmental responsibility have ended up with one more piece of plastic in a landfill somewhere because there was nothing else I could do with this can.  It was simply unusable.  I bought this particular gas can primarily because it had the Briggs & Stratton name on it, which has been a name that I have associated with quality for over 40 years (ever since I was old enough to know about small gasoline engines).  I rather doubt that this spout was actually designed by Briggs & Stratton engineers.  I wonder whether you can really design and build a spout mechanism into a $20 piece of equipment without having a high failure rate.  I don't know.  It obviously doesn't fail for everybody, but it failed on my can.","summary":"Worthless","unixReviewTime":1273881600,"style":{"Size:":" 5 Gallon"},"image":null}

(At this point, I've had it running for 4 months) The instructions and set up are easy.  Then I waited until the sprouts started, which didn't take long.\n\nStrangely, in the dill seed pod, there was only ONE seed, which... needless to say, produced a very scrawny tuft of dill.  That died.\n\nThe cilantro seemed to have so much promise, seemed to be off to an amazing start.  It, too, died.\n\nThe parsely, which is still alive, is really a useless amount of parsley.  I feel guilty when I clip any of it for fear that the plant cannot survive off the tiny amount of leaves that remain.\n\nThe chives, well.... lets just say that they're lacking in length and girth, and thats never a good sign.\n\nHOWEVER! the basil.  Oh the basil - both the regular green and the purple, they will NOT stop growing.  I am constantly cutting it back because the plants are growing up to the lightbulb and burning on the bulb.  I haven't figured out how to use enough of the basil to keep those plants under control.  But then again, basil grows like a weed under any circumstances, so it isn't because of the AeroGrow that they are exploding.\n\nAnd the lights, don't even get me started on the lights!  They are so insanely bright that you don't need to use any other light source in any room that the AeroGrow is in.  I have mine in the kitchen and have resorted to using a curtain to block the glare at night.  I have it set to turn off at 10:00 pm, but until that time, its like the surface of the sun in my kitchen - blinding white light.\n\nThe pump is quite, unless it needs refilling, which is often.  I have mine near the sink so its easy to refill the reservoir when I hear the trickeling noise.  But that noise is actually a pleasant sound, so really, no complaints about that.\n\nBut you know what, for the price of running those lights for all those hours every day, and running that pump for 24 hours every day, I am starting to suspect I could just buy organic herbs and produce and still have money left over for a latte.\n\nYes, its a cute conversation piece and yes its nice to have basil on demand (nothing else really grew at all), but really.... it takes up a lot of counter space, its blindingly bright and it is an energy vampire 365 days out of the year.\n\nSo I give it a solid \"Eh...\" - 3 stars","summary":"Eh....","unixReviewTime":1209081600,"style":{"Color:":" Black"},"image":null}

I thought I'd check the temperature of my walls, floors, ceiling and a few hot water pipes, watch a few pans heat up, and then put it in a drawer.\n\nI've now found the product to be indispensable and use it at least once a day.  I have a gas range.  I can check a pan that is heating and get just the right temperature for fried eggs (300 degrees or so) or pancakes (375 degrees.)  I'm no sure how would cook these items without it.  I heat  the cooking scrambled eggs to about 140 degrees at a high gas setting while stirring, and then cut the fire back to minimal to finish the eggs.\n\nI built a new house in the past few years.  I've used the product to determine how well it is insulated and to find air leaks.  Fortunately I've found I don't have any problems.  I took the device to a friends house which is older and we found all sorts of issues including an uninsulated ceiling in one area.\n\nTo use the device one holds the trigger in.  There is a laser to help with selecting the target point.  When held an foot away from the target the temperature is sensed from a circle with a diameter of one inch.  The holding the device closer or further away changes the diameter of the sensing zone.  As long as the trigger is held the device continues to measure the temperature, even if it changes.  When the trigger is released the last temperature read is held until the device automatically turns off which is in a minute or so.  This operation is totally intuitive.\n\nI thought of writing this review because I just changed the batteries in the device (September 2013).  I've owned it since February, 2012.  It took a minute tops, to change the two AAA batteries.  I consider this to be excellent battery life given how much I use the device.\n\nAlong with the Thermapen thermometer for measuring interior temperatures of food, this product is a must-have for cooking.  The Kintrex thermometer also has other valuable uses around the house.","summary":"\"I've become accustomed to her face...,\" an indispensable product","unixReviewTime":1379808000,"style":null,"image":null}

I moved away from the house a couple months ago, to an apartment, and left the arbor in the yard as a gift to my friend and landlord for helping me move and giving me a nice deal on rent. When I left, the arbor still looked gorgeous and white, and the only thing that was a bit off about it was the footing\/stakes. The yard has some major ground\/soil issues and developed some hollow space on one side of the arbor, making it lean. Some longer stakes would have been nice, but I think these probably would've been fine if the soil hadn't been ridiculous and some of our furry little friends hadn't been digging tunnels everywhere.\n\nIt was absolute bedlam trying to put this thing together, but now that I've got a better idea, I think next time would be faster. You definitely want at least one other person to help you, but two is better. As someone who has a bad habit of doing two-person jobs on my own with some ingenuity, I can tell you not to bother; it will only waste your time and frustrate you. The good news is that once my neighbors and I got it together and the glue dried, it's stayed together. Now, it hasn't been through a hurricane yet, but since it's been anchored, it's been pretty sturdy. No discoloration whatsoever, no bending (though some of the strips -are- flexible), no mold or mildew, and it's hot and humid here.\n\nIt seems pretty sturdy for something that isn't wood or iron, so I'm growing my passiflora edulis on it.

It was an older hose but I really liked it because it was short enough for the spot it was located in.  I spent a long time evaluating all of the other hose menders and decided to select this one.  The solid brass fittings are what made my mind up for me.  Brass will not rust and will not break like the plastic ones available for sale.  Also with the brass the clamps can be tightened much more securely than with plastic.  If you screw the clamps down tightly on plastic there is a good chance it is going to break.  I am glad I chose to purchase the brass set.  I had just moved into the house, had none of my tools available and  did not have time to take on every little project.  My dad lives just up the road so he doesn't mind helping me out with small repair jobs.  He came over to my house and asked me which hose I wanted repaired and where the parts were.  I handed him the hose repair kit and went back into the house.  Three minutes later he walked into the kitchen door and I asked what's wrong.  He answered, \"Nothing. Should there be?\"  I asked him what about the hose.  \"Yeah, what about it?\"  Is it fixed.  He answered yes.  I was shocked and couldn't believe that he finished repairing it within a few minutes because he is 78 years old and has extreme arthritis in his hands.  His hands swell so bad he can hardly move his fingers.  He took me outside to inspect his work.  When I turned on the hose it was not leaking one drop.  It was that easy to repair with this mending kit and the clamps secure the hose tightly.  Months later it still has not leaked one drop and I have my favorite hose back.

Believe it or not, I had a squirrel eat through my supply hose.  It was old and covered with a \"garnish\" of drippings from meals gone by, and in his earnest he chomped all the way through the hose and drained the tank.  I will admit that at first I thought I could seal the hole with the great fixer upper, duct tape.  But it was a no go.  After refilling the tank, the instant smell of gas permeated the air.  (If this happens to you, or you get a hole in yours for any reason, forget the duct tape.  It will leak anyway and be dangerous).  This Weber assembly is pretty much the one that is found around here no matter where you go, so I picked it up.  My grill is a Charbroil, but I feel that this hose can be made to fit any grill.  The tank connector is a universal fit and will screw easily onto any tank.  Its the other end that where you may have to improvise.  Apparently the fitting at the end of the regulator on newer grills has been simplified to a screw on like the tank side, (took them long enough).  My old time dependable grill had a regulator that was not so accommodating.  I solved the problem by completely cutting the fittings off and twisting the end over the regulator valve.  Although its relatively easy to slip on, the regulator valve is thickly threaded and the hose stays tight and secure. Even so, when dealing with gas its best to make sure, so I installed a small worm clamp around the end and the job was done.  Safe and completely without leaks.\n\nIts my opinion that if you are in the need for a new supply line on your gas grill, no matter what brand it is, this universal kit should fit it nicely.  If its a newer one the job becomes a simple matter of screwing to ends on.  If you have an older one, you can improvise as I did and be grilling before you know it.  Its an easy job.  And if you are an online shopper, I feel that ordering this kit here on Amazon will save you a lot of time running around wondering which one to get.  Recommended should you ever have an aggressive squirrel in your future...","summary":"Can Be Made To Fit Any....Good Price","unixReviewTime":1276819200,"style":null,"image":null}

I used it today to spray down the outside of the house and get the dust, cobwebs, etc. off of the siding. It had plenty of pressure to reach into the eaves and get the house looking good again. We have a one-story house with high eaves.\n\nThis also comes with a black plastic male quick connect piece if you have your hoses set up on a quick connect system.\n\nNOTE:  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","summary":"Much better than the pistol grip type I have been using","unixReviewTime":1439164800,"style":null,"image":null}

I can't help but think that this is due to people not understanding how the surrounding environment affects these products.\n\nFirstly, it is not a scientific instrument so a couple of degrees off here or there is fine.  I placed mine inside next to one thermostate and two thermometers.  They all were within 1 1\/2 degrees of one another, but this thermometer was two degrees higher than the average of the others.  To adjust it I simply took hold of the housing of the bimetal thermometer works on the back and turned it gently till it was \"calibrated\" with my other thermometers.  It now resides outside and is within 1 to 1 1\/2 degrees of my electronic thermostats.  That's fine for what this product is.\n\nThe clock is accurate and so is the thermometer, within reasonable expectations as I noted.\n\nA note to users of thermometers:  1, do not place it in the sun, it says this on the box;  2, if it is on a wall and the sun is beating on the wall below the thermometer it will affect the thermometer reading even though the thermometer itself is not in the sun - heat rises; 3. place it where there is a wide margin of shade around this item and it will work just fine; 4, remember that the walls of your house hold heat due to their mass, so when the air cools off at night, and your thermometer is hanging on the wall with its mechanism 1\/2 from that wall, it will register higher than the ambient air temperature until everything equalizes.  For people that expect instant readings and total accuracy, you can buy an instant-read thermometer for over $100, so go do that and stop complaining. If you want an instrument that is decorative, inexpensive, and reasonably accurate then get this one.","summary":"Pretty good and fairly accurate","unixReviewTime":1367539200,"style":{"Package Quantity:":" 1"},"image":null}

The variable speed vac assures that you won't be sucking up rocks, just the leaves on them. The vac is very good for picking up leaves between bedding plants. The only problem is that the zipper on the bag is not robust enough and is prone to sticking when clogged with fine debris. Use too much force to free up the zipper and it will fail. It's covered by a very good warranty, but that's a nuisance. Removing the bag for emptying requires some finesse, but it's not a big problem. The blower is excellent. Switching from blower to vac and back seems tricky at first and also requires some finesse, but it becomes faster and easier with practice.

Once you get the hang of it, you can zap flies in mid air, which saves the time of waiting until they land on something.  It can be tricky but I prefer it over a traditional swatter.  The fly guts don't get all over the object...the fly stays in tact.  Sometimes you have to zap it more than once or even take a napkin and finish the fly off yourself as it's recovering, which is why I didn't give it a 5 star.  I would think with that much voltage, the fly would be killed from one zap.  This may be the result of the batteries wearing down so there's less current zapping the fly.  It's also good for mosquitoes as they are flying through the air, but this netting has larger holes than some smaller racquets, so if you intend to use it on mosquitoes, I might buy another model with double netting or just smaller holes that won't allow the mosquito to fly through the netting holes.","summary":"Works pretty well for flys - You don't have to wait for them to land","unixReviewTime":1441411200,"style":null,"image":null}

As it was past time to invest in one, I chose this due to reviews and pricing at the time. It came assembled, however I followed the instructions and took it apart to be sure the assembly was done well, and it was done very well. After completing all of the quick start instructions, I to include adding bar and chain oil & fuel, I took the saw into our back area to test it and take down an old plumb tree which was 16 inches in diameter at the base. The starting sequence went without a hitch, and the saw cut through the trunk like a hot knife through butter. It cut so well, that I went ahead and cut a dead\/diseased trunk from another tree, with the same results. As for mixing oil and fuel, I decided that since my use of the saw would be pretty infrequent, I went ahead and purchased (3) cans of premixed 40:1 at my local Lowe's. All in all, this is a very good saw, a great price, and yes, I would recommend and purchase again.","summary":"Great Saw","unixReviewTime":1493337600,"style":null,"image":null}

Unfortunately, I had to buy it locally rather than from Amazon, which cost me an extra $25.  That's the price you pay for equipment failure in mid-job.  :-)\n\nIt weighs perhaps 2\/3 of the old trimmer and vibrates perhaps 1\/2 as much.  Still tiring to use for long periods, especially stretched out trying to reach the middle of a big bush, but far less tiring than the original.\n\nThe extra reach over the 16\" trimmers is amazingly helpful.  For the first time at this house, I didn't need a ladder to trim.  The cord minder seems to work better than the original Hedgehog as well.  The cord never came out once.\n\nAfter about 3 hours use, I'm very satisfied with the trimmer.  Worth what I paid for it locally; more than worth the Amazon price.\n\nI'd like to address a couple of things I saw in other reviews.  First is a question about the handle being \"too small to get leverage\".  How much leverage do you need to put on a hedge trimmer?  Unless you're trying to force it through something you shouldn't, the handle is just fine.\n\nThe complaints that it won't cut through the 1\/2\" as advertised.  Yes, that's a legitimate beef, but you shouldn't be doing that anyway with an electric trimmer.  I'm pretty sure that's what killed my first trimmer.  Use loppers and pruning saws for stuff that big.  (You probably also ought to trim more often as well.)\n\nRemember, this is not one of the big gas trimmers.  You want arms like a gorilla, feel free to buy one.  They do a tremendous job, but they get heavy for us occasional users.  Unless you own an estate, this unit should do the job nicely.","summary":"Satisfied so far","unixReviewTime":1289606400,"style":null,"image":null}

Enough reviews complain about the flame and soot and smell and it not staying lit.  Well I figured they must have put something together wrong.  So I can assure you I did not put it together wrong.  Pretty straight forward.  Unit looks very nice.  doors do not line up properly on mine and one door scrapes on the top overhang so you have to yank the sh#% out of it to get it open and closed.  I can live with that but most important is it just doesn't light .  Followed the instructions , tried it 10 different ways.  pilot light goes on.  small flame.  won't ignite to full flame.  On about the 5 or 6th try it all of a sudden \"blows\" and the flame shoots up and it works.  Flame is nice.  But a lot of soot and smell that is not great.  Maybe all propane fires have this smell and soot. Flame works for about 10 minutes then \"poof\" it goes out.  Try to light it and it won't re light.  pilot goes on and that is it.  Messed around with it on 3 days ( one of which with a party of guests ) who now know not to buy this either.  Many reviews say you need to modify the burner air gap to reduce the soot and smell.  I moved it out as far as it will go without \"modifying\" the whole assembly and it still is not good.  And the tile work on top is \"real tile\/slate\" and as such is not even or smooth.  I actually like this \"hand made\" look but others may not.  So keep that in mind if you want to roll the dice on this thing.\n\nSo I want to return it.  But I am not taking it apart ( which will take forever ) and I got rid of the huge amount of boxes and packing material that this came in.  So I hope amazon will just send a truck and take it \"unboxed\".  Not sure what they would do with these pieces of crap anyways that don't work so it really should not matter.  I'll let you know how Amazon comes thru with customer service on something like this.\n\nIt is to bad because the unit looks nice and would be great if it worked properly.

I used this when living in a rental that was kept in poor condition as far as window and door seals go. We had an infestation of yellow sac spiders, which unfortunately hangout on the ceiling in corners and come inside during the fall. The first fall we were there I was seeing up to 5-15 a week, killing them myself. Sprayed this all around the perimeter inside and out of doors and windows every few months. I also caulked the Windows and sealed the doors. The second fall, I saw less of them but they were definitely still getting in. So I just can't tell if just this worked, or if it worked in combination with sealing entry points. The only problem is that they come in during the fall mostly, and you have to re-spray any exteriors that have moisture such as rain or snow.\n\nJust moved into an older home built in the 70's and noticed many spiders in the unfinished basement.

I've raised and showed chickens for over 30 years, so I know just a bit about them. My husband and I live on a large dairy farm with various other animals, and I ordered this because, I had a broody hen who hatched out 4 eggs we put under her and her and her babies were getting way too big for the pet porter we had them in. I wanted a place to put her and her babies (now at 2 months old) in to integrate them back into the flock of 40, while she was teaching them how to go to roost, etc. My husband is so busy; I thought that this coop would be faster than having to build a small transitional coop.\n\nFirst, one box arrived via UPS, and the next day a second box. So, just be aware that if you just get one box you will have to wait for the next box to arrive to complete your coop. The directions are not great either! Good thing, my husband put it together (ha-ha). Measurements are 68 inches by 30 by 41-Inches.\n\nThis coop looks nice. The finish is very nice. The hardware cloth looks to be fairly good quality. Though, this thing is smaller than it looks. Currently, we have the one momma chicken (a standard size Buff Orpington) and her 4 young (3 pullets and 1 cockerel) in there and it really is too small for all of them, but, since it is just transitional, it will work.\n\nIf I was ordering this for a permanent home for chickens, I would NEVER put more than 2 full sized chickens or 4 bantam chickens in this. If chickens are overcrowded you can have a ton of behavior and health problems, such as feather picking, due to boredom.  I added photo's to show how cramped it is with just my one hen and her 4 chicks. Of course, you can move this often to fresh grass and build another run to hook on to give more room.\n\nAlso, one thing I didn't like about this coop is that the ramp into the house is finished wood and it is too slick for chicken's feet. My chickens don't like to use it. I plan on gluing some shingles to it for added traction or adding more wooden slats between the slick wood.\n\nAnother thing, I thought could be improved was the quality of the latches and closures, particularly on the doors. I will probably replace the latches with a better quality latch, as raccoons could easily open up the doors.\n\nI wish there was a sliding cover on the one window in the coop, as during winter at night this could be closed if there were a sliding cover.  When I use this coop in winter I will cover this up at night.\n\nThough, I think this is the perfect coop (with a bit of tweaking and more winterizing) for a broody hen to hatch her brood and raise them if you want her separated from the rest of the flock. Also, this would be perfect for one hen and one rooster if you want to insure that you have purebred fertile eggs- which is what I plan to use it for once my hen and her chicks are integrated back into the big flock.\n\nOverall, I would purchase it again, as it is quick to put up, looks nice, it's easy to get the eggs out, easy to clean and does the job I need it for. Though, if you can build fairly well, and want more than 2 full-sized chickens, we built an 8ftx8ft coop, complete with everything for just $50 more.","summary":"Nice looking, but small and ramp is too slick for chickens feet","unixReviewTime":1366675200,"style":{"Style:":" Chicken Coop with Outdoor Run"},"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61sFH3lF3+L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41wuRJ1-PbL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51K6F3j9b8L._SY88.jpg"]}

I bought these for three reasons: 1) I could get the four filters needed for our tub for less than *half* the cost of four ceramic filters; 2) These are made in the USA; 3) I wanted to experiment with the \"lesser\" style of filters to see the cost\/benefit compared to the (way) more expensive ceramic filters.\n\nAnd then there was the free two day Amazon Prime shipping ...which greatly helped get our tub up and running ASAP.\n\nDo not fear these filters. The Pleatco replacement filters fit our Hot Springs \"Sovereign\" Model II spa tub perfectly. In fact these filters are a bit larger overall than the ceramic filters that came with the tub; they are both a little taller and a bit wider in diameter. Whereas the original ceramic filters slipped on with lots of room to spare, these filters needed just a bit of careful alignment to get them on ...nothing heroic or potentially damaging ...just not as easily as the ceramics. And FYI ...I read a review of a person who bought these filters and complained about having to remove the band on the filters ...you don't remove the band. The band is glued in place and it'is there to help stabilize and keep separated the filter folds; leave it be.\n\nIf you want to make the change to the non-ceramic filters make sure you read up on their care in your owners manual or the Pleatco website; no, you can't toss these in the dishwasher. But keeping them clean isn't much more work than hosing them off regularly and occasionally using the filter cleaning spray solution.

I live in Florida and we have all kind of bugs all year around.\nI did not buy this unit for bats, rats or mice because we never had them in our houses. Snakes are probably taking care of rats and mice for us. I bought the Pest Control for roaches, ants, mosquitoes, spiders, silverfish and flies.\n\nI plugged it in an outlet next to the kitchen and the lights came on. I pressed the test button and heard the terrible sound that is suppose to keep bugs out of the house. If you don`t press the test button you don`t hear anything and the device doesn`t bother you. It has a low and high setting and I put it on high because it is a two story home with more than 2500 square ft. The device is suppose to cover up to 5000 square ft.\nIt has a little night light at the bottom which I find a great idea. So far the device seems to work and we find less and less bugs in the house. If it continues working this will be a great money saver because I would have to pay more for a one time chemical spraying of my house with a pest control service than this device costs. Not only may it be cheaper it is definitely safer than chemicals.\n\nFor a little under $50, I rate this Pest Control device five out of five stars.\nI am thrilled I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review. Opinions are my own and I did not get paid for this review. This is a product I would recommend!","summary":"CHEAPER AND SAFER ALTERNATIVE TO REGULAR PEST CONTROL WITH CHEMICALS","unixReviewTime":1455408000,"style":null,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61H0BgQxtiL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61lGuNpZ66L._SY88.jpg"]}

I called them up and they came out and fixed it within 3 days. Works like a charm now. It's so much quieter than my old Hayward pump even at full speed. Also, since it has a built in controller I got rid of the old timer it was on that always looked like an electrocution waiting to happen. The best part is the $500 rebate I'm going to get from the power company (LADWP) for getting an efficient pump.

The optical quality is obvious even when observed very casually from a point light source hitting the individual diodes' glass.\n\nThe focus is fantastic and, along with the precisely targeted spectral options, makes the light possibly the most efficient I've seen on the market in terms of PAR on leaves per watt.  The hardware would be worth it at most price points -- capital costs on LEDs barely factor into the equation given the extraordinary service life -- but the P1200 is silly cheap for what you get.\n\nI'm just a tinkerer, but it's loaded with other features that larger grow ops will appreciate too: very modular and rigorous engineering, the ability to daisy chain power, and a sales team that actually knows how sausage is made.\n\nThroughout the growth process, I ran into four primary unexpected issues:\n\n1)  Everything I had learned around nutrients, water, spacing, and so forth is now obsolete because the low heat signature and high PAR changes the equation so radically.  I have specimens that are basically solid domes of vegetation about 8 weeks into life and it takes some digging to even see the stem... and it's already pretty wooden when you find it.\n2)  I didn't choose enough hungry varietals.  This light permits aggressive use of basically everything else to get the most out of it because you have so much PAR to work with.\n3)  I'm gonna need to find some more species to grow.  There is only so much fresh produce that one man can consume.\n4)  Commercial scale; probably overkill for almost all home gardens unless you want our own little slice of the Congo Rainforest.\n\nAs of harvest time, the plant might have been dunked in Elmer's.  Kinda surreal and makes working with it more difficult.  A little seems to go a long way, though.","summary":"Score well over PAR","unixReviewTime":1411862400,"style":null,"image":null}

It had not rained for a week and every day was over 100 degrees. Out kitchen was filled with ants. (I learned that they come in looking for water during a drought). We cleaned out every cabinet and sprayed with bug spray until we couldn't see any.\n\nTHEN... I decided to do some research, and learned that all I did was chase them somewhere else. Unless you get to the queen in the nest, they will be back (or they will go somewhere else you don't want).\n\nThe reviews for the Terro PCO baits were fantastic, but they didn't have them at Lowes or Home Depot, so we bought Hot Shot Mini Ultra Liquid Ant Bait instead. I found some places outside and in my garage where there were trails of ants. I placed 4 Hot Shot baits in their trails. The ants mostly ignored 3 of the 4 baits. 1 of the 4 baits (one in the garage) did attract a lot of ants, and sure enough, 2 days later there were almost no ants in my garage.\n\nAfter that, I ordered the higher-rated Terro PCO 6-pack from Amazon to compare.\n\nThe Terro baits came yesterday, and today I found 2 places where I saw some ants outside. I placed one and 15 minutes later, no ants. But an hour later, there was a long trail of ants coming across my driveway and were eating it up like fat kids eating donuts.\n\nI placed a second Terro PCO bait in our front garden, where I saw some ants. Half an hour later it was so filled with ants it looked black. They were streaming from 2 different directions. This thing REALLY attracts the ants. (I recommend reading my Terro review at amazon for more details).\n\n24 hours later, there were NO ants at either site.\n\nBOTTOM  LINE:\nThe Hot Shot baits are OK.  They work, but only IF the ants go to them (and only 1 of the 4 baits I placed actually attracted ants).  I recommend the Hot Shot baits ONLY if you can't get the Terro baits.","summary":"They are just OK","unixReviewTime":1342915200,"style":{"Size:":" Pack of 1"},"image":null}

Ok, In the excitement, I opened the slightly damaged box to find out that there was no damage. I assembled as instructed, added oil to the engine and toped up the Cat pump, all with the specified oils. I also added an hour meter, Pressure gauge  and an in line water filter. The time of truth was extremely disappointing. I had to pull on that sucker almost 10 times. Ok, I let the engine heat up while I tried cleaning a section of concrete. The pressure gauge runs up to 3000psi at idle, however as soon as the trigger is activated the pressure drops to 2500psi. I would have thought that it should maintain 3000psi as advertised. Next I turned off the unit to rest for 5 minutes and tried to start again, I still had to pull 4 times and that is holding the trigger open as to relieve the pressure in the system. I bought this unit as per recommendation of the reviews, saying that it started on the first pull, I am disappointed. I call Yamaha and they referred me to the closest dealer who is about 50 miles away. I called the dealer and was told that this is a normal condition for this small engine. My guess is that Yamaha wrote their own reviews. If I could return it, I would. Acme's return policy clearly states that once gas has been added to the unit, the problem has to be rectified by the dealer. I am going to try Amazon customer satisfaction policy. This unit is absolutely a piece of garbage. It is always hard to start even after bringing to the dealer for service. DO NOT BUY< YOU WILL REGRET> I had a Honda for 22 years prior to buying this garbage. I thought it would have been better, however it is an expensive piece of garbage.

Later in the day, the boys filled the cart with mulched cedar to replenish the bedding around various plantings and trees.  Finally, we lowered the cart's sides --- easy, peasy --- to heap batches of deadfall limbs and tree cuttings, then cart them away to the brush-pile for later mulching.\n\nAn important feature of this solidly-made cart is the extra-long pulling length and broad, comfortable-fitting handle.

I researched bird feeders for weeks and the only one I found that sounded like it would cure our squirrel problem was the Brome 1024.  I was really hesitant about paying so much for a bird feeder, but went ahead and made the investment.  It has been worth the price in every way.\n\nNow after about three months of having the Squirrel Buster feeder mounted on a post in the back yard the thing is working just as advertised.  The birds found it the first day I had it open for business and so far not a single squirrel has manged to steal seeds.  I have the feeder setup on an 18 inch long hanger bracket so that helps discourage squirrel attacks, but if one of the furry critters ever did manage to jump onto the feeder itself the clever feeding port closing system would slam shut.\n\nThe seed capacity of the Brome 1024 is huge and provides food for several weeks in our yard.  So far we have had mostly Juncos and Black Capped Chickadees visit our feeder.  The feeder is easy to fill and to clean.  It is made of nicely finished metal mostly, with the seed hopper being heavy transparent plastic.  This is a quality unit and will certainly last for years.\n\nI think this bird feeder is the best one on the market.  You won't regret buying one.  The birds will thank you.

I have used this type of bird feeder for eight years and it has performed flawlessly. I now bought another for a family member. The feeder has two sides and can dispense a lot of feed, if you want.  I used a piece of plastic and aluminum tape to block off one side and a few of the feeding slots on the other side to reduce the flow of bird seed. Install the blocking  adpation on the insife of the feeder. I have the feeder mounted on a six foot pole in our yard so we can view the birds easily. The feeder has spring-loaded doors that will close if large birds or squirrels attempt to eat the food. The door is spring-loaded and has several pressure settings so it can be adjusted to the types of birds you want to feed from it. I adjusted it to exclude large birds (crows, blackbirds, etc.) but cardinals and blue jays are able to use it easily.\n\nIt comes with a 1\" thin metal pole (four sections) and an adapter with screws that attach to the bottom of the feeder, if you want to use that. I found the steel pole so flimsy that I purchased a 1.5\" diameter plastic water pipe 10' section from Home Depot and installed that in the ground after cutting the pipe to a 7' length (burying one foot deep into the ground). You can use the pipe adapter and shim it for instertion into the plastic pipe to create a very sturdy pole that will withstand any weather. For the new one I purchased the \"Birds choice Mounting Flange For 1\" Pole by Birds Choice\" from amazon.com. It requires some shimming and drilling screw hole into the bottom of the feeder to mount, but it fits the plastic pipe better, especially if you use a 1.5\" to 1.25\" plastic water pipe reduction adapter fitting, also available at Home Depot.  My first pole setup has lasted perfectly for eight years, but I like the newer idea better.","summary":"The very best bird feeder","unixReviewTime":1367452800,"style":{"Color:":" Verona Grn"},"image":null}

Our house has some floor to ceiling windows facing the backyard and between the kids having squirt gun wars and the cat scratching at the windows trying to come in and eat dinner 6 times per day our windows are always kind of streaky.  Every once in awhile I would feel some inspirations and go at the windows with some Windex and paper towels but they never really looked that great when I was done (still streaky) and it was a lot of effort (and paper towels).\n\nSo I was more than willing to put this Karcher through the paces.  Plus the male side of me was kind of excited to add another motorized tool to my collection - the more the better.  So this little shop-vac for windows actually works.  I cleaned and squeegie vaccumed my big rear windows and they look way better than using Windex.  Pretty quick to use and very little streaking - a bit of runnage in the areas to the side of the squeegie.\n\nSo I like this product.  However, around the same time I also began using the \"e-cloth\" that I purchased on Amazon based upon rave reviews.  The e-cloth is low tech - it's just a microfiber cloth and it costs $15. The thing is the e-cloth gets my windows absolutely spotless streak-free with less effort than even this Karcher vac - plus cheaper, no recharging, less noise, etc.  My wife was impressed with the Karcher but she could absolutely not believe how well the little e-cloth worked.\n\nSo in summary, I definitely recommend this Karcher vac over the old chemical methods such as Windex.  I would be using this Karcher now except for my e-cloth discovery.  4-stars for the Karcher in consideration of price-value and if you are allergic to e-cloth.","summary":"Better Than Windex...","unixReviewTime":1358380800,"style":{"Style:":" WV50"},"image":null}

Plan to use it to spray Hyperseal roof sealant and reflective coating on my southern roof (which no one except aircraft  pilots can see.)  Excellent hardware.

The quality of the mower is fine with no obvious flaws in design or assembly.  At first I questioned the cut quality however realized that this was due to the some weeds in my lawn being too high for the reel to cut instead of just push down.  I checked the blade adjustment and all was well.  If you have a thick lawn or one that is mixed (like mine) then this may not be the best mower for you.  If your lawn is pretty much free of weeds and not too thick then this will do just fine.  I must admit this is easier to push than using my self-propelled mower.  What a surprise!  I love being able to mow and hear the kids playing, or my wife calling out to me - and no risk of things being thrown and injuring my children.  They can actually play nearby while I mow!  Would I buy it again?  Probably so, although I'd wait until I had the weeds and non-grass stuff under better control.","summary":"Nice mower but know your lawn before purchasing","unixReviewTime":1182816000,"style":null,"image":null}

It threw the line out, but not so much that it wasn't usable. When I used it this spring, it would throw the line out within seconds of trimming. I put it away and used my little electric trimmer. Today I needed to do trimming around the garden and got it out along with a fist full of .130 size line pieces. I check to make sure they are seated and can't be pulled out, start the trimmer and I can rev it to full speed with no problems. As soon as it touches anything heavier than a blade of grass it throws both the lines at the same time. Problem can't be from wear, since it has only about a half hour total use, and I have tried the two alternate places on the hub with the same results. I bought line the next size down, thinking maybe that was the problem and it does the same thing. The really odd part is that it throws them both, every time it meets a weed.\n\nWarranty is worthless, since you have to pay shipping and a return shipping fee.

Just push down the back lever, wait for it to click and you're done.  Much less stressful than setting a traditional spring loaded rat trap.  I was disappointed that this trap does not come with bait.  The video on the product site showed a person pre-loading with a liquid bait, but noting like that came with this trap.  I did use peanut butter which isn't a big deal, just thought this should come with some sort of bait.\n\nIt's easy to handle and easy to place.

Bermuda grass is not affected nearly as much as wide blade lawn grass. Crabgrass leaves are somewhat similar to St. Augustine grass, so I have seen some minor damage to my St. Augustine grass where I sprayed this product too much. But the St. Augustine grass grows back quickly with new runners. This has only happened in one spot about 6 inches in diameter.  It was the first place I experimented, so I'm sure it was my fault.\n\nEvery time it rains, you need to wait a day or two for the crabgrass to start growing fast again and that is when crabgrass is most susceptible to this week killer.  The directions say to wait another two days before mowing or cutting the crabgrass.  If you cut the crabgrass too soon, you cut away a large part of this crabgrass killer that was still on the leaves that are now lying on the ground disconnected from the roots.  The objective is to wait for at least two or more days for this weed killer to get into the roots to kill the plant from the roots - or it will just keep growing back from the roots below the ground. Do not expect to see instant results, so don't give up too soon. Think in terms of many weeks to kill crabgrass or most of a spring and summer growing season and hope the roots are dead and won't come back next year.\n\nI gave this product 5 stars because it is the only weed killer that I have ever had any success at all with crabgrass.  Most all other products never mention crabgrass and those that do mention crabgrass, don't do anything to crabgrass.  It is a very tough weed to kill and not kill your lawn.  But if you really overdo it, you can kill St. Augustine with this product. It kills other weeds, too.  I am trying to get rid of crabgrass primarily. It's too expensive to use as a general weed killer over an entire yard. It is only available as a hand operated pump in Texas. And with a hand pump, you are not tempted to spray your entire yard with it - just spot applications directly to the plants you want to kill.  Usually, it will not affect St. Augustine grass unless you spray way too much on it.  There are a few different nozzle spray patterns from which to choose.  I have three clusters of crabgrass and I'm trying to keep them from spreading.  But with a vacant lot next door, that is next to impossible. It is loaded with crabgrass.  I have not been successful yet to kill the roots sufficiently to prevent the crabgrass from coming up the next year. But I can get it killed enough before about September that it decides to wait until next year to come up again. I'll probably have to dig up the roots to kill it permanently.\n\nSo remember not to expect instant results on Crabgrass.  Just keep spraying it at opportune moments until it finally starts to wilt. Read the instructions to learn more about the most effective way to use this product. The print is not so easy to read, but it is readable if you have good close up vision.\n\nWhen you first see the leaves wilt, then you know it's going to work. However, you'll have to keep reapplying it for most of the summer.  This Ortho weed killer only works if the crabgrass is growing.  So if it has been dry for a while, intentionally water the crabgrass to make it grow in a couple of days.  Then spray it.  Wait at least two days before cutting the grass so that the Ortho spray has more time be absorbed into the roots.  The main objective is to kill the roots. Otherwise, next spring, the crabgrass will grow from the roots and you have to start all over again.  I may have to resort to digging up some of the worst ones by the roots up after this current rainfall over the past several days. The ground won't be so hard.","summary":"Only Product That Can Actually Kill Crabgrass.

MSakamoto","reviewText":"Orbit is a great name (my opinion) in garden watering products. I have used their garden hose timer products for years and have found them to be very good on average. So when I had the chance to test this multi station smart timer, I was happy to do so. Additionally, since I already have a Rachio 16 station, wifi networked water system controller installed at my home, I knew I would be able to do a good comparison. In fact, most of this review is a comparison of the two.\n\nGood points:\n* the B-hyve has manual controls in addition to its networked phone\/computer interface. So, you can just program it up or control the sprinklers in the same way you used to use your 20 year old electronic sprinter. It's a good back up. The Rachio has no manual controls. You must use your phone or PC\/Mac.\n\n* The casing is rugged, lockable and suitable for outdoor use. The Rachio is for indoor only. It has no water resistance at all.\n\n* It has two sizes of knock-outs for the control wires. One is used for fewer and smaller wires, the other one for larger and more wires.\n\n* Connection process to the wifi network at home worked well, and worked the first time. So did the Rachio.\n\n* The app was easy to load and use. I have an iPhone. It is not, however, as good as the  Rachio app. It's not a disaster, but it's missing some refinement that the Rachio app has.\n  - Rachio allows you to use a custom photo to represent each sprinter group. Seems like a small deal, but it is a big deal if you have 16 zone potential.\n  - Seems like a lot of steps to do simple things when setting up the controller.\n\n* Orbit just has 6 zones, but costs about as much as the 16 zone Rachio.\n\nOverall, since my wires all come to our indoor garage, I prefer the 16 channels of the Rachio to the6 channel rugged, little unit.","summary":"Decent watering system.","unixReviewTime":1467936000,"style":{"Size:":" 6 Station"},"image":null}

It comes with a little mount that you can screw to any wood surface.  I asked my husband to attach a small piece of wood to the top of a 2 x 2 piece of treated wood.  He then attached the mount to that, sunk the post in the ground at an appropriate level, and the feeder just slips right on.  You do have to be mindful of the direction you attach the mount to the post because it is beveled and will only sit one direction.  I set the tension to the heaviest weight it would take, and I have finally seen birds using this.

The plastic bars at the bottom of the FiAir that act as feet are not wide enough. You have to put the thing down JUST SO or it'll roll onto its side. I learned this the hard way this weekend when I was trying to get a fire going.

There's a tiny thumbscrew which must be tightened very hard to maintain the desired angle of the float to the valve arm. If you over-tighten, you can't loosen the thumbscrew by hand. If the valve is located in the pool's narrow  inlet well, there's not enough room to use a pliers, so you have to turn off the water main, remove the valve, readjust the float angle, re-install the valve, you get the picture. Once the thumbscrew corrodes, it won't budge and you have to replace the entire unit. If you finally manage to adjust it, there are too many loose-fitting moving parts which regularly jam or catch on each other, resulting in the constant flow problem mentioned by several other reviewers.

I live on a corner with several hundred feet of concrete sidewalk and a wide (stamped) driveway. I own the neighborhood power washer and I dread having to gear up and hit the sidewalks. The last time it was done, I recruited some teens, but the result was...well, think zebras or prison bars.\nOnce the Yamaha showed up, I waited for the first dry day but had to settle for a brief break in the clouds. I had no problem at all attaching it to my power washerI just removed the \"red\" nozzle and plugged into the Yamaha. Once I got started, what took me by surprise is the lack of side-effect splashing. That is, when I powerwash, I usually catch <explitive deleted> from my wife about the flowers I've decapitated. With the Yamaha, the water stays under the dome. Yes, it took a bit of practice to figure out you can't \"push\" it over the sidewalkyou have to pull. And then I discovered if you let it hover over the surface, it works far more smoothly as when using a sweeping motion like a floor buffer. That's a little harder on my old back, but far easier than using the needle nozzles and having to meticulously overlap each stroke at just the right angle. The result was a virtually streakless sidewalk. One issue is the edgesthey're round while all of the sidewalk edges are square.

{"overall":5,"vote":"14","verified":true,"reviewTime":"07 9, 2016","reviewerID":"A1LMDHM7VS2CPA","asin":"B002U0KDH8","reviewerName":"Eric H","reviewText":"Product arrived in the original box about 30x30 without damage. We did extensive research on spreaders before deciding on the Agri-Fab 45-0462. The area to be covered by the spreader is between 10,000-15,000 sf of turf. The grass type is St. Augustine. We fertilize between 6-8 times per year as we are in Florida so durability of the spreader is important. The primary fertilizer we spread is Milorganite.\n\nInitial impressions: Unit arrived quickly without damage. Opening the package the product is shipped in pieces and packed sufficiently to reduce damage. The parts are of a substantial quality and the finish appears durable. The hopper is fairly large for ease of filling and the amount of material it can hold. The tires and wheels are fairly heavy duty. The frame coating and painted surfaces appear to be a powder coated steel with substantial thickness for durability.\n\nAssembly: Unit requires full assembly. You will need a socket set, small rubber mallet and needle nose pliers. Since the gear box is sent without grease you will need to take it apart to grease it. It is very easy to gain access to the inside of the gear box as it only involves 3 clips. I used synthetic grease for the gear box. It took me about 2 hours to assemble the unit and it was easy. You will want to spread all parts out first and review the diagram carefully. Follow instructions!\n\nUse: Spreader feels balanced and smooth during use. The spreader rate is very easy to use and change as it involves a wing nut with a calibration scale. I set mine at about 3 for the Milorganite. The spreader stops material sufficiently when you move the lever to off with no leaks. A clip rotates material in the hopper to prevent clumping. Material appears to spread evenly and is dependent on speed of the operator and the opening size. Unit is very easy to clean after use as all parts have sufficient clearance to clean properly. I use a garden hose and blow the unit off with a blower that is used on the driveway.\n\nConclusion: The unit works extremely well and is well built for heavy use. It has no flimsy cable that either goes out of adjustment or break. Plan to take time to put it together. If you have basic hand tool skills this is a very easy task. If you don't take the time to construct the unit properly you will not have satisfactory results. Those of you looking for a well built mid grade spreader will be happy with this one. Remember to keep it clean. Take care of your tools they will take care of you.","summary":"Well built easy to use","unixReviewTime":1468022400,"style":{"Size:":" 130-lb Capacity"},"image":null}

The only guaranteed method is a high fence, but that is not always practical, economic or even aesthetic.  Therefore, we resort to chemical repellants, automated sprinklers and the like.  I am battling a herd of deer who live in the woods near my neighborhood whose gardens they use as a personal smorgasbord.  Because their direction of attack is varied, and there is no one specific deer path, it is difficult to use this Electronic Repellent to block all entries.  The set-up is very easy.  One does need to remember to periodically check the batteries, renew the scent, move the stakes if the location is not right.  And you can block certain avenues of attack.  However, this works better if there is a single main deer path, and your plant predation is relatively low.  Otherwise, be prepared to combine this with other weapons in your arsenal.","summary":"Only one tool in the arsenal against the suburban menace","unixReviewTime":1314403200,"style":null,"image":null}

This is made out of hard plastic that isn't as thick as I expected. I have already seen it bend slightly when I was leaning over while sitting on it to pull a weed that was almost out of reach.  I am trying to remember not to do that now, but Im pretty sure this isn't going to last long and that there will be sharp edges when it breaks. But while its working:\n\nOne of the reasons I wanted this is that it has handles to help you stand when you are kneeling to pull weeds, etc.  Unfortunately this is too narrow for that to work. I still have to get up the same way I do from my old kneeling pad. And my old kneeling pad has much better cushioning for my knees. There is a slight give to the kneeling pad on this, but not enough for my knees. They started hurting very quickly. Also, the bottom is pretty much flat on the ground so you can only use it where that doesnt matter. I had a metal gardening bench that raised the kneeling platform up a couple of inches which made it more versatile as to where you could place it to work from.\n\nFor sitting, the seat is at a very good height for me and I like that the top does not have raised handles making it very easy to swivel around on the seat. It has no padding at all though so sitting on it all day during major gardening efforts became rather painful. I kept trying to shift positions but it didn't help.\n\nSo yeah, Im using it for sitting work because its what I have, but Im a little worried about getting hurt when it breaks, and when I replace it I will try to get something more useful for kneeling work.","summary":"I hope it doesnt hurt me when it breaks.","unixReviewTime":1520121600,"style":null,"image":null}

I have had a bat problem for 10 years. They love my vestibule area. They huddle in the corners. At one time the bats did migrate south so I would have maybe a 2-3 month respite. Then many started to stay all year. Now I have nothing against bats. They do a good job and I appreciate that. BUT, they make a mess with droppings near my paver front door area. Every night. And when I'm away, I come home to a big mess. Now I've tried many suggested remedies to keep them away. None worked. I was skeptical of product like this one...and there are several. Still, I was desperate. I set the switches for \"bat control\". There is a \"variable\" and \"constant\" mode. That's the high pitch that the bats (hopefully) don't like. I tried both. Constant worked better. Okay, the results. At first I continued to have a problem. I have a \"L\" shaped entry area so I tried various locations for coverage. After about 2 weeks I started to see a change. Fewer visitors. I did experiment with location and direction control. I have found that a location on the outside corner of my \"L\" area worked best. I also have adopted an upward slant to the box. Now that I've had several months to test, including a month away, I have had no nightly visitors. What a relief. This product has worked wonders for me. I highly recommend you give it a try. I'm not sure of the real coverage area when walls or other obstacles are in the path. But I also have a covered patio on the back of the house and in the past the bats used that as their base of operations. No longer. You need a power outlet for this product. It has continued to work flawlessly regardless of weather conditions. For me that means hot sun, high temps, cold (20-30 degrees) nights. No problems.","summary":"It Works","unixReviewTime":1501718400,"style":null,"image":null}

Even the huge Plumerias in the Disney resorts are covered with orange powder this time of year.  But not mine - this stuff has kept me rust free this year.  I have 6 Plumeria plants that are about 6 feet tall, and I started using the immunox at the first sign of rust (about July 4).  It only takes about a half a gallon in a pump sprayer to treat them all (be sure to spray the bottoms of the leaves too), and I apply it about every two weeks.  All of my Plumeria trees are still growing and blooming while others in the neighborhood are losing all their leaves due to the rust.  This is good stuff.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI live in Florida, and I have several Plumeria plants that were covered in Plumeria rust this fall.  I had been using Orthenex as part of my standard insect\/disease spray regimen, but it was not helping with the rust.  After some Internet research I found a few products that were reported to work, but could not find a suitably small quantity of any of them, so I decided to give this fungicide a try.  After a couple of applications, it seems to have cleared the rust and the plants are growing new leaves.","summary":"Seems to be working on Plumeria rust","unixReviewTime":1354838400,"style":{"Pattern:":" Case Pack of 1"},"image":null}

This spring I have 13 and plan for more. They pay for themselves in one season. For example, I got over 30 tomatoes from one box, and that was a low yield. I've met people who have EBs going strong after 15 years. The home made versions usually last a couple years or are <not> food grade. So if you value your time and money, invest in EB.\n\nEBs are scientifically balanced thus following set up instructions precisely will produce the best yield. Their online forum at earthbox.com is a wonderful support. The members are wonderfully knowledgeable and giving. Some have PhDs in horticulture, yet give information freely and frequently. I usually get a response to my questions within hours, no later than a couple days.\n\nEBs don't use \"soil.\" They will yield more and have less disease problems when we follow manufacture instructions as to the type if potting mix is optimal. Read the forum before starting and you'll avoid common newbie errors.\n\nI never had problems with the wheels as some reviews mentioned. With the box upside down, I insert and press firmly till I hear a snap. They never fall out. They roll easily and have a lock to keep stationary when needed. For transporting longer distances I use a mover's dolly which fits nicely between the wheels.\n\nEBs keep the plants so healthy that they are less prone to disease, thus require less work to maintain. They have an automatic watering system option that minimizes the work further still.\n\nI've spent most of my time as a new gardening learning about insects so I know which are good and which are harmful to the plant. I have so many good bugs in my yard that I rarely have to spray. My worst problem is squirrels playing in the new potting mix.\n\nI had a problem with one of the boxes cracking; customer service at earthbox.com replaced it immediately and assured me the faulty mold producing the weak box had been replaced. When I bought mine, they provided a satisfaction guarantee for one year. So no risk.\n\nSummary:\nEarth Box is a great investment in one's health as the yield on home grown veggies provides optimal nutrition at minimal cost especially if we use our boxes for years to come. They are scientific, resourceful, and can be life changing. I started mine in memory of my deceased mother as it reflected her nurturing life and commitment to healthy habits. I've not been disappointed.\n\n10\/24\/12\nI now have 20+ Earth Boxes. ;-)","summary":"13 and growing - the big picture","unixReviewTime":1329782400,"style":{"Color:":" Terra Cotta"},"image":null}

This was my first gasoline powered leaf blower and I thought mixing gas and oil might be a hassle and more importantly I was concerned that the blower might be difficult to start, especially for my wife.  As it turns out mixing gas and oil is a very simple procedure and should not prevent you from buying this leaf blower.  Likewise this Hitachi leaf blower is very easy to start.  The best testimonial I can give about how easy to start this leaf blower is, My wife regularly starts and uses this leaf blower without my assistance.  My sister and my 78 year old father also love this leaf blower and both find this leaf blower easy to start.  My wife won't mix the gas and oil, she still gets me to do that for her but as far as starting goes, when she wants to use the leaf blower she just picks it up and a couple pulls and it's good to go for her.\n\nPerformance:  Yes this leaf blower is easy to start but it is equally impressive when it comes to performance.  My next door neighbour has a Echo gas leaf blower and my other neighbour across the street has a Sthil gas blower.  Both neighbours agree my Hitachi leaf blower is more powerful than either the Echo or Sthil mainly due to the tapered concentrator nozzle at the end of the blower tube.  As far as weight is concerned all three gas blowers are about the same weight and all are nicely balanced but as far as power goes the Hitachi has a more powerful air flow.\n\nCons:  While the Hitachi blower is easy to start, well balanced and powerful there is one feature that is missing on this blower that is included on some competitors and that is a 'Trigger Lock Button'.  I don't know why Hitachi didn't include a trigger lock on this blower, it certainly is not an expensive item to include and is certainly a useful and convenient feature.  If you have a large yard or you are a landscaping professional and will be using this leaf blower for hours a day you definitely miss the trigger lock, for the rest of us a trigger lock would be nice but shouldn't be a deal breaker.\n\nSummer-Winter:  My wife and I have used this leaf blower year round, Spring, Summer, Winter and Fall.  In the spring, summer and fall we use the Hitachi leaf blower for grass clippings, leaves, cleaning the sidewalks, deck and driveway.  The most surprising use we get from this leaf blower is cleaning snow from the sidewalks and driveway in the winter time.  When buy this leaf blower we never anticipated using this blower in the winter to clear snow but it's awesome at clearing light skiffs of snow and much easier and faster than sweeping or shovelling.\n\nSummary:\nIn my opinion this Hitachi RB24EAP is the BEST handheld gasoline powered leaf blower available.  It's compact, powerful and easy to start, even for my wife.  The blower works great in the spring, summer and fall for leaf and grass blowing and general deck, sidewalk and driveway cleaning.  This leaf blower works equally well in the winter time and works great for light snow removal.\n\nI've purchased four of these leaf blowers and the oldest one is almost four years old.  They're all still working great and continue to be easy to start.","summary":"Best Blower ...  from a repeat buyer, long time user","unixReviewTime":1464220800,"style":null,"image":null}

Easy to clean up with no touching.\nWhen setting the trap, it  often snaps and scares the daylights out of you, but is easily reset.\nI hope it lasts...so far so good.\nHave a chipmunk problem in the garage, this trap has been successful thus far.\nGave 4 stars as too new to me, need long term results for 5 stars.\n\nUpdate: 12\/7\/15\nContinue to love.....BUT after 6 months of intermittent use, and less than 10 successes (only because I am not home) the trap no longer will stay open. I tried cleaning it to be sure nothing was caught causing it to trip or not fully open to set. Nothing is in the way, so assume after this period of time the spring has sprung. Very disappointing as this was the best and cleanest trap I have ever used.

I've been using a manual push mower and was ready for an upgrade. It was relatively easy to put together although I think the directions could be much improved.\n\nI used it for the first time today on seriously overgrown grass. It was at weed wacking height and a bit wet. I set the wheel height at the tallest (3.5\"), left the bag off and hoped for the best. It did a great job and I actually enjoyed mowing the lawn for a change.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how quiet this is, even when it's set to \"power\" mode. It's light enough to operate with one hand and I like that you can use either hand to hold the lever to keep it turned on. This really helps with discomfort from gripping and vibration. It's a breeze to turn on and off. No crazy long cord to yank.\n\nIt took less than an hour for the battery to be at full charge out of the box and there was no indication of the battery running low after at least 30 minutes of run time. Removing and replacing the battery is really easy...literally lift in and out. It will fall out if you tip the mower over, which I discovered when I was wiping off the underside after mowing.\n\nThe cutting path is narrow as other reviewers have mentioned (picture cutting a foot wide strip of your lawn at a time), which is fine for my purposes, but would be insufficient for larger lawns I think.\n\nI'm kind of excited to mow the lawn again soon :)","summary":"Great, quiet little mower for small lawns","unixReviewTime":1369094400,"style":null,"image":null}

To expand my gardening space last year I added a Topsy Turvy planter.  I grew cherry tomatos in it, because they tend to stay more compact and produce a lot of small sweet tomatos.\n\nThe main down fall of tomatos growing in the topsy turvy planter can be the lack of water because the dirt dries out much quicker than the dirt around tomatoes planted in the ground.  To solve this problem I used a drip irrigation system on a timer which released a small amount of water into the plant several times a day.  This kept my tomatos very happy and healthy.

The water would sit there for days and hardly go down. I had to clean it often because it would develop little brown things in the water from being closed in. My chickens would drink out of the duck's water or out of mud  puddles instead. So I switched back to my old waterer with an open bottom tray for them to drink out of and immediately we started going through a lot more water. I put the waterer on an upside down plastic bin so the ducks can't reach it and muddy up the water. That solution has worked for me and it's what I'm sticking with.

Obviously the reviews were important in making the decision because we wanted something that we wouldn't be disappointed in. Now that I have it I can say that this grill is perfect for camping! We actually have a RV, but like to cook outside as much as possible. Before having this grill we would buy charcoal and travel with a small BBQ.  It was a hassle having to both start a campfire and grill, now we only do one.  The property we stay at most of the time we have built a 3 foot wide fire pit that is surrounded by landscaping stones. The legs of  this grill sit perfectly on the stones and give us about 12-18 inches above our fire. So far we've heated up our coffee percolator, cooked breakfast in a cast iron pan and grilled burgers and hot dogs directly on the grill. The best part? It cleans up easy by just letting any food burn off over the fire and then it stores flat! This is a heavy duty grill and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for one.  I expect it will last many years!\n\nIf you need a smaller size Texsport does sell a couple others here on Amazon.\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Texsport-Heavy-Duty-Camp-24-X-16-Grill\/dp\/B000P9F092\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Texsport Heavy Duty Camp 24\" X 16\" Grill<\/a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Texsport-Heavy-Duty-Camp-16-x-12-Grill\/dp\/B000P9IRKQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Texsport Heavy Duty Camp 16\" x 12\" Grill<\/a>","summary":"It's everything it claims to be!","unixReviewTime":1248825600,"style":{"Size:":" Extra Large"},"image":null}

I cannot express the convenience this piece of machinery offers and it isn't back-breaking heavy.  Need to reach up high into some trees?  This will do the job.  Have some bushes or shrubs that are a little unruly but you need more control while trimming them?

I actually enjoyed pruning my hedges and doing a little artwork with them.  They turned out rather nice (if I do say so myself).\n\nThe only caveat that some people may have is that it is a corded item, not gas powered.

I didn't need gorilla strength so I went with this and it's been perfect so far! Dimensions are exact and the tent is pretty simple to put together. The crossbars are currently supporting 50 pounds no problem.\n\nMy only gripe is that the zippers often got stuck when I was trying to zip it all together. The zippers and material themselves are high quality and durable, but there is a seam very close to the teeth of the zipper that gets caught. It's a tiny excess of fabric, had to go around with my fingernail loosening every inch in order to finally get it to zip. This took me no joke 45 minutes to zip up the first time. I thought it would be a constant problem, but the more progress I made the easier it got. I've zipped it up about 20 times now and it's already wearing in to the point that I can zip it shut very easily with no catches. So it's really not a big deal and I urge anyone having similar problems to just patiently work the thread-line and it'll start smoothing out.\n\nThe only other complaint I have is there are minor pinhole light leaks around the seams. Not eye catching unless you're already looking at it. I may spray paint or smear black silicone over them eventually to make it 100% lightproof.

The peanut butter can't sit in there forever, eventually it gets a little rotten and you don't want that smell in your house so it has to be cleaned. The peanut butter, once smeared to the back wall, is imbedded into the vent holes and into the cracks and corners of the inside compartment. I bought 2 units and each unit took me 20 minutes to clean with a bunch of toothpicks, qtips anda bottle of rubbing alcohol. Not well designed with this in mind at all and at this price point, I expect more. Perhaps the sellers are just hoping you'll give up and throw it out so you can buy another one from them?

I actually call it my \"super classy inflatable hot tub\", because hey, if I say it out loud enough times that'll make it true, right?

Instead, the filters are underwater, and after a failed attempt at using a pool skimmer to clean it up (in the most classy way possible, of course), I needed something better. Enter Scumbug. I throw a couple of these bad boys in, run the bubbles, and they collect the gunk like crazy ... and I'm talking \"change colors to an icky brown at the water line\" crazy. Rinse 'em out in the wash tub & repeat. Now this is an excellent product, but given the way that they look when I'm done ... well, I'm going to have to double-down on the \"call it classy to make it classy\" approach to my doubleplusclassy luxury inflatable spa. Nothing so gross should ever come out of such a classy tub.\n\nA tip - Regularly take this out & clean it, don't let it get super scummy in between washes. I accidentally had one flip over on me after it had collected a lot of gunk, and by the time I realized it had happened, all of the gunk had washed back off into the water.

They can easily puncture the hose (this can be fixed, though, as the kit comes with \"goof plugs\".\n\nI highly recommend this sprinkler system.

We had the La Crosse Technology WS-9611U for years. It was less expensive and really provided everything we want. The 308-1451 is overkill but still a good gadget to have.\n\nI'm really only looking for the time, temperature, and humidity. It's easy to see all of them on the 308-1451. It's nice that the time is sync'd with an official clock over the airwaves, so there is never a concern about the accuracy. I like that it is very easy to find the button to turn on the light in the middle of the night. It is a big button on the top of the display.\n\nLike the old station, this one occasionally loses connection with the probe outside and won't show the outdoor status for several minutes.

Sometimes you get these little succulents and they are in potting soil which isn't good for drainage. Packed extremely well, double boxed with finely shredded paper over the plant tops and a heating pack underneath. Included instruction sheet.\n\nI bought these on a Lightning Deal to make arrangements for gifts. These usually cost about two dollars individually so it was a no-brainer. They are good beginners succulents. If your household is dry remember to water more often because this is not potting soil and does not become waterlogged like potting soil. In other words, the medium is more likely to dry much quicker. This can be remedied by either putting a piece of oasis or sponge underneath at the bottom of the soil to retain water or using glazed pots instead of glass, terracotta or plastic, or by keeping them in a humidity dome or covered terrarium.\n\nI am satisfied with my purchase and being a person who ships many items on a daily basis, I was highly impressed by the packaging.\n\nEdit: updated rating to reflect that plants have fungus gnats, which I have isolated to these plants.

Johnson","reviewText":"I just recently received this gas can and couldn't wait to test it so I filled it with water instead of gasoline to confirm that the mfr claims are true.\n\nIt does work as shown in the mfr video -- for the most part.  Initially, the push button mechanism was sticking.  When I released it to stop the flow, water continued to pour out.  Once I operated the push button a few times it began to retract all the way and the valve sealed tightly.\n\nThen I tested the auto shut-off feature.  It works, but the flow of water did not stop immediately.  As another reviewer pointed out, vacuum must build up inside the can first.  I was filling a 16 oz. jar and the level ended up being about 3\/4\" above the level of the end of the nozzle.  I had to hold the nozzle down at least 1\" below the top of the jar so it wouldn't overflow.  As long as the user holds the can so that the nozzle is well inside the tank it should work well.\n\nFinally, I had to try a tall shot glass, like they did in the video.  The push button shuts off the flow quickly enough to accurately fill the shot glass, but the auto shut-off isn't fast enough.  Water poured over the top of the glass for 2-3 seconds before the flow stopped.  It may not work for small fuel tanks (leaf blowers, chain saws, etc).\n\nBottom line -- it doesn't leak, the cap has an o-ring to seal it, the push button valve works well (after the initial sticking problem cleared up), and the auto shut-off feature is useful for larger tanks where it doesn't need to work instantly.  The plastic is thicker than most and the molding is high quality.  The threads are clean and smooth and the surface where the o-ring seals is finished well.\n\nI'm giving it 4 stars because of the sticking push button assembly.  It is working now, but it feels cheap and doesn't fill me with confidence.  The rest of the can appears to be solid.","summary":"Works as advertised","unixReviewTime":1377475200,"style":{"Size:":" One Size"},"image":null}

Sometimes we don't get started as early as we would like so my husband ends up in the backyard with a flashlight to finish our meal. So when I told him that we would be testing & reviewing this Grillumintor BBQ Grill Light, he was happy to try it.\nThis grill light is very easy to set up & very easy to use. It comes with the 3 AA batteries needed for it to work which is a big plus in my book. When a company provides everything you need to use their product straight out of the box, I really appreciate that. You just need a tiny screwdriver to take the battery cover off so you can install the batteries. Now you're ready to use your new grill light.\nThis grill light can easily be attached to so many different things & be used so many different ways, not just for grilling. We do use it on the handle of our grill when we need it, but we've also attached it to the pipes under the sink when we had a plumbing problem that needed to be fixed. My husband has used it in his backyard work shed when he needs more direct light than the overhead fixture provides. I even used it to find our flashlights when we lost power during a storm a couple of weeks ago. So don't think this is a single-use product because you'll be surprised how much you use it!\nWe'll definitely be taking this durable grill light with us on camping trips this season. It will come in handy in so many ways.

After mine rusted, Joraform told me I wasn't using it correctly. However, I followed their instructions to the T. Every time I put material into the unit I put in a ratio of 1 part wood chips to 10 parts composting material. They said my compost was too wet and that wasn't enough. But the instructions are still the same. They said the problem is that liquid from the kitchen scraps turns too acidic and when it seeps out of the unit through the seams between the panels, it will rust the unit. The liquid will always seep out through the seams between the panels because they are not sealed. Mine started to rust in year 2 and is now completely unusable in year 6.

York","reviewText":"This is a large patio set that comfortably sits 4, perhaps 7 cozy friends (assuming 2 sit on the included ottomans).  The seating position is low to the ground and lets you have a relaxed, reclined position.  The center table is sturdy and large enough that it doesn't shake too much if you bump it.\n\nThe wicker is coated and has an almost plastic-like quality.  I think this will help it survive out in the sun.  Despite being labeled \"brown\/tan\", the color of the wicker is sort of brownish\/dark grayish.\n\nThe cushion fabric is not soft, but it does appear quite sturdy. The cushions are fluffy and wick away water...to a point.  After a heavy soaking rain, the cushions retain some water and the fastest way to dry them is to squeeze out the water.  Without some help, the cushions will be wet all day after an overnight rain.  This is similar to other cushions I have so it's not a big surprise.  The cushions do not have a zipper so you can't replace the internals.\n\nNone of the pieces are stackable so if you plan to store them indoors in the winter, you'll have to get creative with how to save space.\n\nI like that each piece feels sturdy and yet doesn't weigh a ton.  The wicker exterior wraps a black steel frame.  The base of the love seat is supported by a wicker weave and, to my eye, looks like the part that might fail first if someone too heavy sits on it or a kid started jumping on it.  We'll see how it holds up.\n\nDELIVERY\n-----------------------------\nThis set is delivered by a freight company.  I got it a few days after placing my order.  About two days before the delivery I got a call from the freight company specifying a day and a delivery window.  I told them that their delivery window (1-5pm) didn't work for me so they agreed to move it until after 5pm.  The day of the delivery, at 12:30pm, I got a call from the driver telling me \"I'll be at your house in 30 minutes\".  So much for rescheduling!  Fortunately, I was home for lunch and just waited around until he showed up.  The driver was very helpful and courageously hoisted the entire setup up my fairly steep driveway and into my garage.  He even carried away the pallet that it came on.\n\nDespite the scheduling issue, I was pleased with the delivery experience.  I'm pretty sure that if I hadn't been home, the driver would have just turned around and come back during the proper delivery window after 5pm..\n\nASSEMBLY\n-----------------------------\nBelieve it or not, everything you see here comes in one huge box.  For this reason, a small amount of assembly is required.  It took me almost as long to get things lifted out of the box as it did to assemble the love seat and the table.  The love seat bench seating is fastened to the back by way of metal brackets and 7 screws.  Happily, all 7 screws lined up perfectly with their brackets so it was simply a matter of inserting the screws and tightening.  The kit includes a wrench but I'd go dig out a 10mm socket wrench to greatly speed up the process.\n\nThe table is the hardest part to assemble.  You have to attach the four legs to the base and top with 12 screws.  Until you get the first group of screws in, getting things lined up is a bit of a chore.  The 10mm socket wrench was a lifesaver here.  Just for grins, I tried using their included throw-away wrench: not good.  I'd only use that if you are stranded on a desert island.\n\nSummary\n-----------------------------\nSo far, this seems like a great patio set that will serve my family well as we head into Spring.  I plan on spending a lot of time outside lounging around.  If anything turns negative, I'll update my review.","summary":"great for the outdoor retreat","unixReviewTime":1427846400,"style":{"Color:":" Cream"},"image":null}

My wife and I tried sitting on it at the same time (probably around 300 pounds together) and it feels completely stable, which is rare for a wicker chair (or maybe I'm just used to weaker wicker chairs). The wicker is covered with \"powder-coated aluminum\" which makes the surface feel a bit slick (not in a bad way - in a splinter-proof way). The color is nice and subtle and would probably fit in with most design schemes.\n\nThe description says to bring it inside during \"inclement weather\" and I can see why. Although it's \"weather-resistant\" I can't see this thing holding up to too much rain and sun exposure. This seems like the perfect chair for a screened in porch, though. We put it in our sun-room (not technically outside but definitely separate from the rest of the house). The high back and arms make it extremely comfortable for sitting and talking or even just sitting and reading. The cushion material is the one thing I'm not sure about - it seems a little flimsy for such a serious chair.\n\nOverall, this is a really solid wicker chair.

I was able to clean the gutters on my 2-story house and unclog the drain pipes, for far less money than a one-time \"professional\" cleaning.

In my efforts, I purchased a electronic device by Viktor (thinking it would be more humane - a quick zap and it's over), the Cube and the J.T. Eaton Repeator. I read the directions carefully and baited the Viktor electronic device with a dab (rice size) of peanut butter. The next morning, the green light was flashing (indicating a kill) but when I opened the unit - the peanut butter was gone and just some pee stains remained. No mouse! Worse off, the mouse probably got a decent zap, but not enough of a zap to kill it - stumbled off somewhere and is most likely suffering a bit too - something I DID NOT WANT! So I tried another device - the \"Cube\" which advertises as a \"No kill, humane\" device. While it DID catch a mouse - the mouse died from lack of oxygen. Unless you can check the trap every hour or so and don't care about your sleep - the mouse will die as there are no oxygen holes in the trap! Lastly, I purchased the \"J.T. 421CL Repeater Multiple Catch Mouse Trap\". (Viktor makes a similar one to this if you can't get the J.T.version). I baited the J.T. with a tiny amount of peanut butter for scent and the trap worked GREAT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it - It is a no kill trap (it has plenty of air holes and a clear plastic\/metal lid for easy viewing and release). I have since \"relocated\" Mr. Mouse #2 to the forest. I'm sure he's happy and so am I!  The J.T. Repeater is the clear WINNER in my opinion!","summary":"The Better Humane Choice and it Works!

After several Weber charcoal units, after a couple old electric and propane Char-broilers that used Lava Rock, after so many tedious to use, hard to operate, just plain nasty grill & BBQ'S, It looks like we finally found what has been missing all along. This grill is so fast, so effortless to operate, and about my fear of grilling with only propane with no lava rock or charcoal meant no \"flavor\"? BOY was I wrong!\n  I light this and close the lid. 10 minutes later, throw on a steak of burgers or both along with something our cats (Lucy & Ethel) will like (NO, not mice...). 10-12 minutes later, it's all finished and perfect. Of course I turn over each item 1\/2 way through. It has more flavor than ANY grill or BBQ owned in my 61 years, period. It is a beautiful grill to look at, it has so many clever design elements everywhere I look, I am still kind of dazzled. There are already a hundred reviews in great detail by those who know far more than myself about grilling so this is just to point out, that it is a truly wonderful grill, easy to operate, easy to clean, a joy to look at, food tastes amazing. The BEST part? It is MADE IN THE U.S.A.\n  It is such a joy to find something that offers so much, is rewarding every time you use it, and then goes further to make you feel the pride of owning something USA made. I just don't know how it could get any better? I found a website that shows a nice video that makes assembly take just 30 minutes or less providing you don't do what I did (remember, I am an IDIOT on things mechanical. I noted this video was a NON American product so wonder what differences I would find other than the propane connector? Well after putting it together and tearing it all down again, and then back together the 4th time (successfully finally!) I can direct you to the website for help but know BEFOREHAND, what differences to look for. The differences are:\n-Our USA model has a front and back side that IS different, it matters that the side with 2 inside screw holes be on the back. Reason? It's because our version comes with a heavy metal bracket NOT shown in the video assembly.\n-The other mistake I made was on the bottom bracket, there is a difference as to which way is front versus back. Again, the video is for a foreign model that doesn't NOT have yet another missing part, the propane tank \"holder\" or resting platform.\n\n  Nonetheless, this video is an amazing help to aid in assembly. I also have no regrets as to all my build & tear-down fun, I now KNOW this grill! And everything is simply amazing in it's design to all flow together. I also had never even opened the instruction book to look beforehand since I am no good with instructions! If I had however, I would have instantly seen there were these 2 parts included that the darn video never showed. Oh well, now I am a master Grill Assembler....\n\n  The great video to aid in assembly is at: [...]WHY don't they want you to know of a video that helps to assemble?????\n\n  If this URL is censored out, contact me for the link. Or got to youtube at search for:\nBarbecue a gas Weber Q300: istruzioni per il montaggio\nMike\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n6\/21\/2010 update:\n\n  My BBQ was always lit by using an old fashioned fireplace lighter. Since I had used charcoal for 40+ years it was just habit. I finally decided to try my red button auto light. It didn't work. I tried everything per the book, no luck. I called Weber tech support. Oh the shock! An American company still using REAL Americans? Yep. After I regained consciousness, The very nice woman insisted she send me a whole new button and igniter assy. I told her I didn't need it as I was completely happy using my old fashioned lighter. She still insisted so I said fine. FEDEX brings it a couple days later & I check it out. Hooked up the wires to test it and immediately get a cute little ZAP (don't try this at home...) I learned where to hold it and where NOT to hold it! But it sparked perfectly every time so I installed it. About a 5 minute piece of cake. Put it all back together & it still doesn't work. So I take the old unit out & test it while in my hand. It also works perfectly so now I am confused. I pull out the burners again to look and this time pay attention. The problem is so simple....the instruction book says to turn on the OUTSIDE burner to ignite. CAN'T happen! The ignitor is directly at the small INNER burner.....So, I turn on the inner burner 1st & it lights 1st click, every single time since and that's now about 15 BBQ's later. If you have this or it's sister model 320 series, try reversing the lighting instructions. Light using the INNER burner, then turn on the outer, just opposite the directions.\n\n  I called the very nice & helpful customer service to inform them and they agreed the book is wrong after testing my discovery. I told them I would gladly pay myself to send back their NOT defective parts and they refused & just told me thanks for the info & to enjoy my extra parts. So....when you wonder if buying American is worth the extra cost, if buying a Weber is worth the extra cost, don't wonder! It's not only worth it, it's actually priceless.\nMike","summary":"FINALLY, A Clean, Quick & Easy Way To Cook","unixReviewTime":1274486400,"style":null,"image":null}

I took the fabric and created shades that hang from the top.  They range from 4 to 10 feet wide. This was a very inexpensive alternative to buying blinds.  The fabric was not at all hard to work with.  I used Coolaroo clips (which can be purchased on Amazon) and also sewed hems here and there.  The fabric worked very well overall.  I was almost a bit plastic feeling, but considering the price and quantity, it was sufficient for my needs.  My only complaint, as others have inferred, is that the fabric is rolled in a somewhat uneven fashion which made measuring and hanging somewhat challenging.  Other than that, my project came out great and very inexpensive considering alternatives available.  In terms of heat blockage, it does a really nice job.  I lower the shades in the morning and it reduces the temperature a good 5 - 10 degrees.

So getting them to come to a feeder has been a breeze.  They're highly entertaining, and making nectar is a lot easier than messing with bird seed!\n\nFrom the start, I put a hanging feeder in the front yard on a shepherd's hook. On the patio window, I placed a Perky Pet Window Mount feeder.  From the living room, I can see both feeders.  There's almost always someone at one or the other, sometimes both.  Hummer fans will surely understand how special this is.\n\nThe reason I bought Perky Pet is because locally, that's what every store carries.  This is the only window mount feeder available in the brick and mortar stores.  It's a frustrating product though.  I've never had a problem with the suction cup.  I've had petals blow off, but the hummers don't mind that.  The problem is the prongs on the back of the reservoir.  Sometime, they're going to break.  I've had them break on first filling and fiftieth filling, and even if I can get the well to stay on the reservoir for awhile, eventually it slides off.  I only mount one of these at a time, and have bought as many as 3 in a season.  I've also had them last more than one season but never more than two.  The hummers get frustrated if the food disappears.  They chase us around!\n\nI've emailed Perky Pet about this issue, which they acknowledge.  That's been a couple years ago, and I bought a new one this spring, because last year's broke.  Well, two weeks ago, a prong broke off, and I know I'm on borrowed time.

After checking a local shop specializing in tractors and such, I felt that $23 for a replacement blade was too much. After looking at Sears, I found a blade but it did not have the STAR CENTER CUT that the original blade has.\n\nI was very happy to find this blade here at such a low price. I actually ordered two based on the part number included in the description as well as the picture. The only issue is that the picture is incorrect. The replacement blade does NOT have the STAR CENTER CUT but has been made to circumvent this by using a wider opening (thus the 4 of 5 stars - it would be 5 stars if the picture was clearer and the description was written better i.e. \"This blade does not have the STAR CENTER CUT but will fit your lawnmower regardless. The special cut allows for the blade to be attached properly with no worries\").\n\nI did install the blade and it DID fit nicely. No worries or safety concerns from what I can tell. I mowed the lawn and it cut perfectly on both bagging and mulching mode.

Also, when cleaning the filter, it may look clean (white) but don't\nlet that fool you, as most of the sediment is trapped in the inside folds of the filter where\nyou can't see it; just spray off the filter and out comes brown stuff you would never see by\njust looking at the filter.\nAddendum:\nAfter running this pump\/filter for two seasons (my seasons are about 8 months long as I live in the desert) for an average of 6 to 8 hours a day, I can say this is a very strong pump and I have had no problems with it.\nSomething else I have learned about the filters, is that you don't need a bunch of them, as I have been running off the same filter for the two years, I just unscrew the top as the unit is running, spray off the filter, put it back in, close the lid (not to tight), turn off the power, unscrew the air vent and let all the trapped air out, and then start up the pump again.\nAddendum 1: I have been using this Pump\/Filter for over three years now with NO PROBLEMS.\nIntex has a new number for this Pump\/Filter; it is: 28637EG\nAddendum 2:  This is the start of the 4th year on this pump.  I ran the pump for a few days, and I noticed the GFI was tripping, after four or five restarts, the pump impeller started to make an uneven sound, and then it just stopped. I will use the back up pump I have, and have ordered another back up.  At $45.00,  three years of service is acceptable.\nI disassembled the bad unit, and the impeller had no damage, so the motor windings (potted) went out. I pulled the impeller and plastic coated magnet (all one unit) out, and anything else I could use for spare parts, and installed the new pump.\nAlso, at minimum before you toss the old unit, clip the extension cord and GFI plug, as the 25ft cord and plug are worth about half what you are spending on the whole pump!","summary":"Replaced iPool Pump\/Filter.

I owned two Mantis tillers that I used to till up a 12 X 36 foot raised bed garden twice a year.  First one needed carburetor replacement after warranty ran out.  Never was able to get it to run well since.  Second one I sold because I could no longer pull on it fast enough and long enough to keep it running.  I bought this electric.  1.  It tills my garden better than the Mantis ever did.  2.  With the three position wheel settings, tilling is a LOT LESS effort than the Mantis.

Lomenzo","reviewText":"Just some things to keep in mind --- the first hassle, believe it or not, is getting the PWS [Personal Weather Station] out of the box as it has two VERY TINY phillips screws attached to a disk and then attached to the PWS itself. I can well understand the frustration another reviewer had getting those tiny screws out of there as a normal or even mid-size phillips head screwdriver simply won't work and you just about need those eyeglasses kit tools and\/or specialized very small phillips head screwdriver to get those seemingly welded [! -- they are screwed into the PWS very tight!] screws out of there. Mercifully, I had to dig around my electronic toolkit downstairs and dig up a small phillips head to do the job. My guess is that these are so-termed \"security screws\" but it's a hassle. Anyway, BE SURE to have your hand UNDER the PWS after you're working on the last screw to prevent the PWS from then falling out of its carrier. Chuckle time! Note the directions which say to remove the hugh advertisement stick-on on the face of the PWS in order to use the PWS!  Duhhhh! Ya' gotta' love it!\n\nMeanwhile, when you're waiting [and waiting!] for the so-termed \"atomic clock\" [** Even NIST itself rebels against such wordage as \"atomic clock\" and state that virtually all of these commercially advertised \"atomic clocks\" are in actuality, and I quote, \"radio controlled clocks\" from a radio received signal [60KhZ] coming from Fort Collins, CO, AKA, WWBV] to click in, you may have a long wait! It takes time! Until that \"code\" is received and much depends on your geographical location, the receiver itself and where the PWS is located, you could wait up to 10 hours or more before you get the signal. You'll know when you have it as the satellite icon [with NO blinking] stays continually ON just to the right of the time. Note too, you MUST go through the time setting user selected 10 steps [set WWVB time to ON, set time zone where you are, DST (if wanted so that AZ and HI folks can skip it since those states don't use it ---why we don't chuck DST escapes me but that's another forum ...], 12\/24 hour clock , hour, minute, year, month, date, F\/C temps] or you'll wind up spinning your wheels. The \"instructions\", such as they are, are virtually useless so, roughly, find the \"TIME SET\" button on the right side of the PWS  and ==HOLD IT IN== until you see the word \"ON\", at this point ==release== the TIME SET button and go down to the PWS right side UP and DOWN button arrows, the PWS will cycle through =10= mentioned settings and on ==EACH ONE== of them you then confirm EACH individual setting by pressing the TIME SET button ONCE, then go back to the down arrow for the next user setting, confirm with the TIME SET button and basically repeat the process and \"set\" each setting. For example, the LAST setting will be Fahrenheit\/Celsius [it is set to FAHRENHEIT by default] so press the TIME SET button to \"confirm\" that and the PWS will be \"set\" to read the degrees in Fahrenheit. The process is tricky and can be a bit frustrating so take your time! Of note, I set the clock MANUALLY [using the arrow keys] figuring the WWBV signal and \"sync\" will eventually pop in by itself at around 2AM [I was working late doing some research on one Harry \"Chippy\" McNish and my anticipated defense of Chippy getting the Polar Medal posthumously -- long story, that one], anyway, around 2AM, the satellite icon suddenly popped in and the PWS automatically set itself up with the WWBV time, day of the week and the correct date. The satellite icon then then stayed on permanently.\n\nI like the idea that the PWS uses BOTH an included AC plug-in 5 volt AC to DC plug-in adapter ==AND== a battery back-up [Note! NO batteries are included! The PWS takes ==3== AAA's in the PWS  unit itself and then ==2== AA's for the remote and, mind you, there is only ==ONE== remote with no provision in this PWS for any more than ONE remote which explains why I have other PWS's in the house that offer more readings and the use of multiple remote sensors [on other models] but 'not' this one  which only offers a single remote sensor.  The PWS has a pleasing and colorful look about it [although I could do without the cheesy flower pot and daisy icon] and I'm quite satisfied with the indoor\/outdoor readings in terms of accuracy.\n\nAs for the remote and the first rule of giving it time to reach the outside temperature AND the blue bar graph signal connection icon [if you're getting nothing, press the side mounted HEAT\/DEW button which will help in the remote 'finding' the main unit and vice versa, if still nothing, reinstall the batteries], anyway, nothing can mess up a remote more than poor placement of the remote sensor unit in terms of poor, inaccurate or, indeed, no reading whatsoever!  If you live in the north with very cold temps, I strongly recommend using two AA LITHIUM batteries for the outside sensor. Last week we had temps at night of MINUS 23 [!] degrees up this way [in the upstate NY Adirondack mountains area] and last night was minus 18 degrees with a wind-chill estimate [with the wind] of minus 42 degrees. Lithium batteries [over alkaline batteries] deal very well and sustained very cold weather. So too, even during the day, keep the remote in a totally SHADED area for the most accurate readings! It surprizes some folks on a very cold yet bright sunny day, the outside remote suddenly starts 'rising' [!] but this is often caused by the sun reflecting off snow and affecting the sensor so that while your local weather folks are reporting let's say 15 degrees, your outdoor sensor that is =not= in the shade, may be showing 25 to 30 degrees [!] but ONLY because of the effect of the very bright sun on the outside snow being reflected upward and which duly throws the sensor out of whack. Look for a totally shaded area [on a roof protected outside porch would be idea] and preferably do ==not== have the sensor in the face of any wind [or whirling snow for that matter] for the most accurate DAY TIME readings. Fresh batteries [NONE of which are included in this PWS] are a must and, as I said, lithium is highly recommended for the outside sensor. They last a long time and do very well in very cold weather. And yes, the PWS WILL work without any batteries in the main unit via the AC adapter but the 3 batteries in the main unit serve as a back-up in the event of power loss. As for the outside remote, those two AA batteries are obviously required.\n\nI use three PWS devices but they do different jobs although some things are obviously duplicated. For example, because winters up here can often be extremely cold, I use one PWS that is 'dedicated' to checking the temp in my downstairs basement back utility room where the house 50 gallon water heater is located and outside submerged water pump piping enter the house from the outside and the big fear in sustained minus weather is cracked pipes so I monitor the temperature of the utility room [with an alarm] where the water heater and assorted house piping is located. The second sensor goes in my attached but unheated garage. Another PWS offers digital pressure readings with pressure reading tracking  so that the pressure \"rising or falling\" can be both visualized and recorded. Ditto the dew point, heat index and read-off CO2 because to supplement all electric heating [which can get mighty expensive!], I use propane ==in conjunction== with a total electric heated and powered house or else the electric bill [for a two level house] would, be staggering. I even have a temp sensor in the attic for summer monitoring as circulated air in an attic is important in extreme heat situations during the summer. Enjoy!\n\nDoc Tony","summary":"A few things to keep in mind ...","unixReviewTime":1421193600,"style":null,"image":null}

Last year I tried hatching for the first time with a similar incubator of a different brand but for a handful of reasons it didn't go so well. This year I learned from my mistakes and I'm hoping for a better hatch rate. Like I said, I'm just doing this for kicks but if you are really serious about a high hatch rate you probably want to go with a more advanced incubator.\n\nPROS:\nI really like that this model is a combo with the fan and turner instead of having to buy everything separately. I also like that the styrofoam has a plastic covering to protect and possibly make more efficient. With PATIENCE and careful tweaking you CAN get this machine to hold a fairly constant temp (fluctuates about 2 degrees at most).\n\nCONS:\nFan and turner are loud and vibrate. The built in thermometer and hygrometer are basically useless INVEST IN A GOOD ALTERNATE METER! The built in therm is off by about 5 degrees and the hygro is off by about 20%. The water wells are hard to see and hard to fill - I've gotten it wrong a couple times and it leaks all over the place.\n\nConclusion --> This is not a plug in and forget machine. Take the time to get the machine up to temp and then monitor for at least 24hrs before putting eggs in. If you change the temp, just twist knob a tiny hair at a time and wait for results. Remember - it may take several minutes for the machine to adjust and for your meter to detect the change. Once you do this it IS a stable machine. Do not trust the thermometer included - get a really good one that you know you can trust.\n\nI haven't had my hatch yet and will update if anything changes drastically.","summary":"So far, so good...","unixReviewTime":1420156800,"style":null,"image":null}

Preheat your oven to 325 degrees, wash your 6558 griddle with detergent; I recommend using a chain mail scrubber if you have baked-on crust. Since the griddle is technically cast iron, you may see rust spots as you'd do with a regular cast iron skillet. Just scour the rust off with a scrubber (or steel wool if you need to). Rinse and thoroughly dry the griddle. Pour 1\/2 tsp of vegetable oil on the top of the griddle and rub the oil in with a paper or cloth towel. Cover as much surface area as you can. Flip the griddle over, apply another 1\/2 tsp of vegetable oil and repeat. Be sure to rub the sides too. Once rubbed with oil, bake in the pre-heated oven on the center rack for an hour. Clean-up is now a lot easier than ever.\n\nI've read a few reviews that claim that this griddle is heavy. I placed it on our bathroom scale and it weighs a back breaking 4.8 lbs. In all fairness, it weighs just about the same as the right half grate it replaces on the Q. With that out of the way, I like to say that this griddle is the perfect companion to the Weber Q (we have the green Q 1200). It cooks unconventional grill items that are otherwise impossible or difficult to cook on the standard grates, such as fish, scallops, shrimps and just about any breakfast items (hash browns, eggs, bacon strips, links, etc.). It also acts as mini flattop great for flipping burgers, French toasts and pancakes.\n\nEver since we acquired this griddle, we've done all of our breakfast cooking outside of the kitchen and on the Q 1200 in our balcony - easy clean up and don't need to run the vent fan or deal with cooking fumes permeating throughout the home. For an awesome pancake recipe, look up \"Instant pancake\" by Alton Brown, easy to make and cooks exceptionally well on this griddle. We also took the Q 1200 with us on our July 4th weekend road trip and made scrumptious breakfast with it.\n\nIf you cook your steak sous vide style, such as an Anova Precision Cooker, the Weber 6558 griddle will create a gorgeous seared crust in 30 seconds at 500 degrees (see photos).\n\nPro-tip: Grab a can of Weber non-stick spray for use with this griddle, it's the only non-stick spray you'll ever need. While many users mistaken the porcelain-coated surface as a non-stick coating, it is not non-stick. If you toss your food onto the griddle without greasing it up first thinking it's non-stick, you'll have a very rude awakening.","summary":"Great Weber Q accessory to have, when you need it!","unixReviewTime":1435622400,"style":null,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Cz9o8iK2L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71AKGLst9FL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81Yaql+2LTL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81z2rT47OYL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81zfJLngvoL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/811Btkoc9HL._SY88.jpg"]}

The handles are very comfortable and feel very sturdy.  I have only been able to use the spade and clippers so far but so far they have held up perfectly.  I'll update this once they go through the more heavy use that warmer weather will bring, I've often had handles break off while digging in my very rocky soil so that's one thing that I'll be sure to update.\n  The pockets are great because they are big\/ deep enough that the tools do not fall out easily when walking around even if they are not secured by the top elastic ring.  I almost wish this was an apron type of thing instead of a carrying bag though because I'm afraid that it could be left outside in the rain and turn into a small pool.

Voles are about the size of a field mouse and look similar but they run through the grass eating the grass and roots leaving brown lines in your yard.\n\nThe best way I have found to get rid of voles is to use a mouse trap at the beginning of the runs. I can usually find them holes in my mulched beds and I just place them with the opening over the hole. I have tried other mouse traps and they are worthless. With these I have caught the little critters in sometimes just a few minutes after placing them.\n\nThe traps are a little gruesome but they do kill the voles instantly which I feel is way more humane than a sticky trap. It is also safer than using poison because other animals can get into the poison or eat the poisoned animals.\n\nThe traps work like a classic mouse trap but covered. A spring loaded metal bar is pulled back and held in place in a notched area. When the mouse or vole enters the trap, it steps on a floating piece of plastic. The weight of the animal releases the bar from the notch and the mouse is crushed instantly by the force of the bar.\n\nThese little covered traps will generally not cause a problem with catching other unwanted animals although one time I did catch a snake who was going through looking for rodents.\n\nThe traps are relatively easy to set especially the first time. They are meant to be for individual use but I can usually get 5 or more uses from each trap. I use a mouse attractant gel in mine but you could use peanut butter or bird seeds etc. Once you have caught a mouse or vole, you can pick the trap up without coming into contact with the animal and press the lever in the back which can release the dead animal from the trap. I usually go out back and drop them in the field because we have lots of hawks looking for food and they are always gone in a few hours. If you prefer you can release the dead mouse\/vole into a trash bag.\n\nI paid $24.43 for this set of five traps and feel that was a pretty good value at less than $5 each.\n\nThanks for reading my review, if you have questions let me know in the comments\n\n:-)\n\nBecky Brooks","summary":"D-Con Mouse Trap Review - Awespme for Voles too!","unixReviewTime":1460246400,"style":null,"image":null}

This is my opinion:\n\nThe construction of this light is very solid.  The solid magnetic base is heavy enough to offset the 24\" gooseneck light so that it doesn't fall over.  The magnets are strong and will hold the light upright and even extended out fully from a flat surface and up to about a 45 degree angle.  The light is bright and a bit on the bluish side of the spectrum as you can see in the pictures.  The orange light in the background is actually a normal tungsten bulb, so the camera has reduced the blue in the picture to make the BBQ light look more \"white\".\n\nYou can see the light attached both with the magnets on the right side and with the clamp on the left.  One problem I ran into was that with the long neck of the light, you have to bend the light away from the grill to be able to close and open the cover.  The best place on my grill to mount it was simply with the magnets on the right side.  I tried mounting to the grill cover handle, but it was just too awkward when opening and closing the cover with the 24\" light whipping around.\n\nThe light color makes the items on the grill look pale, so it's not easy to see how \"done\" it is just by sight.  I would prefer a more tungsten, or at least closer to about 4500K, colored light when looking at food.\n\nThat said, this light is probably more useful around the house than on the BBQ.  I agree with another reviewer that it makes a good work light in the garage or workshop.  It could also be clamped to a desk for direct lighting in your craft or other workspace.  I did review another BBQ light which is OK -- I like how it attaches though:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/HOMEAN-Super-Bright-10-LED-BBQ-Grill-Light\/dp\/B00R98WAQI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">HOMEAN Super Bright 10 LED BBQ Grill Light<\/a>","summary":"Advertised as BBQ Light, but better for general Task Lighting","unixReviewTime":1441670400,"style":null,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71GeTTzUZeL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/713++Z+YvaL._SY88.jpg"]}

Measuring about 8 1\/2\" front to back x 6\" wide x 6 1\/2\" height; Airmax recommends that you place pump on something to keep water out [i.e. heavy rains], I used a 1 1\/2\" thick stone block. It is also recommended that you cover the pump for protection from sun\/rain, etc. I ended up buying a Airmax True Rock cover. It hasn't arrived yet so will do a review on it when it comes.\n\nNOTE: this kit is designed for use in \"decorative\" backyard Koi\/goldfish\/water-gardens. It is NOT for a farm [fishing] pond or lake which holds a much larger volume of water than backyard\/decorative ponds and thus require a much larger aeration system than the KoiAir1 or 2.\n\nUPDATE 3\/2017\nWith Spring here [well almost] I removed the leaf net from my pond and I am amazed!

In fact, I have designed several myself.\n\nHere we have a solid copper bowl, a steel three-legged support, a wire cover\/screen, and a vinyl rain cover for when the unit is cool and not in use. The idea here is to build a fire in the bowl so that folks can sit around it, roast a few marshmallows or hot dogs on a stick, and enjoy the evening. You can do that. The company recommends that you put sand in the bottom of the bowl and I wholly agree with that. Here are my issues:\n\n1. The copper is too thin. A really hot fire could potentially weaken the walls and possibly melt through over time (hence the sand in the bowl helps to alleviate this problem but I still would much limit the size\/heat of the fire.)\n\n2. The feet on the tripod support are entirely too small at the base. If you have the weight of sand and firewood in the bowl and the ground is soft, this thing is going to sink. If it sinks on one side only, this could cause some difficulties, depending upon how you are using the unit. I think it's also too flimsy. So you're probably going to need to set this up on some thin bricks if you plan to use this in your yard, (especially if you plan to use the same spot all the time.)\n\n3. There are no air vents in the bowl. (This may have been an intentional design feature to keep the fire from getting too hot.)\n\n4. Cleaning out the ashes, (without taking your sand with it), is somewhat of a hassle, a very slow and dirty project. This, I might add, is a problem with almost all campfire rings and fire pits. You MUST remove ashes after use because they are caustic and, (especially if water gets in the bowl), the bowl will deteriorate.\n\nThere are other minor issues but those are the four chief drawbacks as I see them. I would characterize the unit overall, as \"a looker\" rather than a highly functional unit. Given the materials used, I would have made it half the diameter that it is, thus making the copper twice as thick. The same goes for the tripod supports and I would also have added round foot pads which were at least six inches across. A few air holes low on the sides to enhance combustion would be nice too.\n\nUsing this unit for cooking, (such as a pot of beans, or laying a grill across the top) would definitely not be recommended.\n\nI really liked the idea of the copper bowl in terms of quality materials but I think the designer got pretty far afield in terms of utility. I wish they would have called me (or another outdoor recreation professional) -- I would have steered them in a superior direction.\n\nIn summary, if you want a small campfire, two or three evenings during the summer just to enjoy the night and entertain the kids a bit, then this will probably work for you. However, if I tried to use this unit as I do use my own portable fire pits, (I currently have two, both home-made), it would be in the junk-pile in about a week.\n\nRecommended for light use.","summary":"Designed chiefly for looks [quick details]","unixReviewTime":1366848000,"style":null,"image":null}

It is a metal shed [about 2000 Sq Ft] with only 1 small window. Perfect place for bats to shack up. I have a motion sensor alarm that alerts my house if ANY intruder moves & after no false alarms for 5 years suddenly it became obvious that bats had moved in. MANY people have bats without knowing it. Bats are almost helpless if anything interupts their sonar sound system & this unit stopped my false alarms almost instantly. After I saw how nice it worked I moved it under my house that I live in. Most houses in Kentucky have no basement but a crawl space to sevice plumbing,wiring ect. My crawl space is about 3-4 feet tall with plastic on the ground neat & clean. Suddenly had some rodent move in [maybe a squirrel] that started tearing up some insulation. After no success in trapping it I went to my shed & got my ET pest unit & the varmint moved out as suddenly as it had come in. This unit is so versital in repelling so MANY different kind of pests & uses NO harmful chemicals or poisons. I am ordering more of these units to put under my other rental houses because it is trouble free,not noticable,works 24-7 & I calculate electric cost at about 25 cents per month. To control almost all pests just set the pitch to \"Variable\" & it will drive em all out with it`s inconspicuous squalling sounds. It has a test button you can push to hear the sound at YOUR ear level & that will convince you that it will drive the pests crazy when they hear it at THEIR ear level.

I have added a second analog thermometer so I can keep an eye on the temps across the chamber. Out of the box it can be 50-75 F difference between the one near the firebox and the one near the chimney.

Probably 14 or 16 gauge? Whereas, a quality made smoker would be constructed with something like 1\/4\" steel. It doesn't seem like much of a difference, but trust me, it makes all the difference! The thicker steel allows the unit to retain heat longer and slows down heat fluctuations.\n\nJust to give some background, Oklahoma Joe's used to manufacture their smokers from steel pipe right here in Oklahoma using real oilfield grade pipe line material; heavy stuff.

I was surprised at how lightweight it was when it first arrived; but it's well manufactured and the light weight of it doesn't deter from its durability. Not too over-sized, it fits perfectly on the deck without hogging up the sitting area. But even if it did hog up the deck, what a knockout bronze beauty it is; a true conversational piece among guests.\n\nWhether you sit by it alone and chill or in a group, it will brighten any home and set a fiery mood that will help create everlasting memories. Is it a necessity? No, of course not. But once you welcome the addition to your home, you'll realize just how much you don't want to live without it.\n\nAs a side note, when this first arrived, it was a warm summer day, but, heck, everyone was excited and ran for wood to burn in the new fire pit. What a memorable summer fire that was ... now those summer fires are turning into a tradition. I highly recommend this fire pit for almost any household.","summary":"Set your mood on fire","unixReviewTime":1500681600,"style":null,"image":null}

Further, the PocketBoy 170's come with a smooth, close-fitting, clear plastic case that protects the rest of your gear if in your backpack, waist pack or back pocket. Finally, replacement blades for all 3 are readily available on Amazon (from Japan), and do arrive quite quickly; replacement blades mean field replacement is possible, while with competitive product you might as well just buy another saw instead.\nI have compared the medium (Black) and coarse (Red) PocketBoys with competitive saws from Corona, Ace Hardware, and Coghlan's, and found that the PocketBoy Red (coarse) does outperform the others in a \"number of strokes\" test to cut through a 4\" hardwood branch. (Corona a close second), PocketBoy Black (medium) ties with the others - but the cut is much cleaner and effort 'smoother' with the PocketBoy.\nIf you're looking for a good backpacking saw, give the PocketBoy 170 Red (coarse) or Black (medium) a serious consideration.","summary":"PocketBoy 170 (Black or Red) plus Case makes a great backpacking saw or landscaping tool","unixReviewTime":1466121600,"style":null,"image":null}

Unmodified, the Bradley smokers will provide a semi-cold smoke by turning the main heating element off.

That's undesirable when making foods intended to stay raw during the smoking process, such as bacon, cheese, and many sausages.\n\nThis device provides a simple solution by putting distance between the smoke generator and the smoking chamber. The heat stays in the adapter box, while the smoke cools as it travels upward to the main unit. Assembly is simple (no tools needed, just lift the biscuette burner off the main unit and place it on the adapter, then attach the adapter plate where the burner was) and the steel adapter is a safer alternative to home-fabricated solutions made out of cardboard boxes, which have the risk of catching fire. The unit was surprisingly sturdy and the door offers easy access to the water pan and discarded biscuettes.\n\nAll in all, this is a worthy accessory for the Bradley owner who wants to cold smoke foods with no risk of overheating the product.","summary":"True Cold Smoke","unixReviewTime":1330646400,"style":null,"image":null}

I think it's overpriced when one considers it's really just a two-breaker panel with two breakers - a 60 AMP and a 100 AMP.\n\nThe most irritating part of this is the lack of an isolated ground bar. There is a single bus bar for ground\/common, but this should almost never be done because the NEC rules apparently say that common and ground should only be connected at the main service panel.\n\nTherefore, to install this properly, one needs to buy an additional bus bar. The most affordable option is to purchase a new GROUND bar that can screw right to the back of the box, then use the existing bar for common since it appears to be insulated from the box. However, don't take my advice on any of this but seek a professional, licensed electrician to evaluate your situation.\n\nA small irritant I found is that if one reverses the position of the breakers, the cover doesn't fit. You can either flip the whole box upside down if you need\/want a breaker on a given side, or you have to carefully pull the labels off the sides and switch them . I suppose that indicates that the positioning within the box isn't exactly symmetrical. It was more of an annoyance. Another irritant for persnickety persons like myself was the color of this box which deviates from the gray color used in many other panels. Silly, I know, but I'd prefer a gray panel. Perhaps this is intentional so that it's not confused for a sub-panel?\n\nAside from the above, there was at least adequate space for wiring - all of which I did with #4 and #6 AWG wire which is very think and inflexible.","summary":"Overpriced but adequate for the job","unixReviewTime":1404345600,"style":null,"image":null}

I bought it from Home Depot (get it same day and I get a 10% military discount).\nI have three relatively minor complaints about this sweeper:\n1. The assembly instructions are in the wordless picture format. It was a little difficult to figure it out (& I am mechanically inclined). If they would include an English description for it drawing, it would be helpful. During assembly, I only had one minor problem with one drawing and - to be fair - the drawing was complete but I missed a small item fly out picture.\n2. The dump procedure is difficult using a zero turn (dump arm is not long enough to reach from the seat). So, I have to park the mower and dump the sweeper. However, this is not a biggie either.\n3. The sweeper should have a \"neutral\" drive position. I have to cross a gravel driveway and the sweeper continues picking up everything in its path - including rocks.\nOtherwise, I have nothing but praise for it! None of the above issues is even close to causing me to reconsider the purchase. Rather, I am very pleased with it. It will reduce the leaf blower use by at least 3-4 hours each job.\nFirst, the main body is made with reasonably thick steel. (Compare the overall shipping weight with competitive devices - the heavier item probably has more \"real\" steel).\nI put the machine together and connected it to my zero turn with the wheel setting in the default position and started to work. We have a *LOT* of trees and there was about 3\" of leaves in most of the yard. It cleaned up everything! Leaves, twigs, and small branches. The only problem I experienced was where the ground was very wet and the leaves were very thick. At that, the wheels stop turning and start dragging on the grass.","summary":"Picks up everything but fails traction if ground is wet","unixReviewTime":1512950400,"style":{"Size:":" 1-(Pack)"},"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71YDoxdP1vL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71X3dGqBFVL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71s8F751VuL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61CfXy-mWUL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/710UkVcpflL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71yzDalW7BL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71jpA+hMa5L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Mb0xLnCsL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81EPxKRR-IL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71dY0QIySfL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81o9YV0TrBL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71jENuHKOmL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/810GcC9+xaL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81AqPL55NrL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81Mp7OctPpL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81zen-mjzVL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81vF7M6pi-L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/91wL1x+5GBL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/918aRKqGMQL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/91NXohJ7IdL._SY88.jpg"]}

This is a fairly heavy item shipped, and so I jsust couldn't imagine dong that.\n\nI also tried to take off the feet from the remaining three legs, but one of the three simply would not come off - it's stuck.\n\nSo basically I had a problem with two out of four of the legs that came with this. And it's just enough to be annoying.\n\nSo - aside from the little feet that have been a huge pain in the rear, the fire pit itself is very nice and well worth the price. No other issues even remotely identified yet. I would buy one again for our next place, but hoping that it would come fully assembled.","summary":"Great Fire Pit - Assuming they ship you a complete unit","unixReviewTime":1426291200,"style":null,"image":null}

I was surprised by how small the griddle is, and expect this to be good for cooking veggies for no more than 2 people--which is what I did this time.  I grilled chunks of sweet peppers, onions, and cherry tomatoes and it was definitely easier than anything else I've tried.  I brushed the griddle with some refined coconut oil, seasoned the veggies and cooked until tender crisp.  It's not the same as directly on the grill; I didn't get a char on the food but it tasted great. As for bacon, I would need something twice this size for us.\n\nI'll update this review when the Spring thaw arrives and we start grilling regularly again.","summary":"Small griddle but a handy tool","unixReviewTime":1425772800,"style":null,"image":null}

The pictures on Amazon just do not really do this bistro type table and chairs justice - they are actually really nice.\n\nThe idea was for this set to look like wood resin, although it is made out of a weather resistant PE resin wicker. The resin looks very good and even has some coloring difference so it really resembles a real wood wicker table. In fact there is a big benefit here as the resin wicker will not be destroyed by rain and dampness like a wood one and overall it should possess a very long life factoring that in.\n\nIt comes all pre assembled so there is nothing for you to put together! The set sure feels sturdy, and the chairs say they can support up to 280 pounds but Im nowhere near that so I cant test it to be sure but it feels great to sit on and relax.\n\nThe table and chair all fold up well so they can easily be stored in a closet or garage but I will just be leaving mine on the patio. It's a breeze to open them and this would make a nice little card or puzzle table. The surfaces usable space is approximately 24\" X 24\" and although that is not tremendous, I think it's perfect for sitting and having my first cup of joe outside while staring at the mountains and trees and wondering what bark is made out of.\n\nFor the price at $128 this Bistro set is pretty good deal - It isn't going to be for everyone but I really like the style and really can't find fault with it. Again, much nicer than the product images portray it.\n\nProduct provided for review - its just my opinion","summary":"Patio Resin Rattan","unixReviewTime":1445817600,"style":{"Color:":" Brown"},"image":null}

At the same time, we were sick of reseeding every year because the yard got burned out. So, my husband ran about a dozen hoses and sprinklers and timers and made his own sprinkler system which looked ugly and drove me nuts! Not to mention every time we cut the grass we had to move them. So, I buried all of the hoses throughout the yard and was so proud of myself however I had these ugly sprinklers sticking up out of the yard and figured there had to be a solution so I spent a day day researching solution and found these had pretty high customer reviews. So, I took a chance and ordered a set. I have to tell you, it is the best investment we have ever made! They are such great quality, literally the EXACT same equipment used for the inground full sprinkler systems, the only difference is they connect to your house with the quick connection.

You can pick this up by the attached bail handle and carry it to the beach, to a fixed campsite, or wherever. Check the measurements, it's more compact than it looks in most photos. It's about the size of a standard fishing tackle box ( a little bigger than a shoebox).\n\nThe oval grill on top can flip over to adjust its height. The hinged front 'door' allows you to feed in additional wood, sticks or other fuel after the fire has started and allows you to rearrange the coals with a poker as needed. There's another air intake opening below the door with a detachable cover that you can slide to control air flow. The more air, the hotter the flame.\n\nThis is 100% solid cast iron. These have been around since the 1930s when they were first introduced by the Birmingham Stove company in Alabama as the 'Sportsman's Grill' and marketed to hunters and fishermen. That family-owned company went under around 1990 and Lodge cast iron company acquired the patents, the molds etc and ever since 1990 has been producing this current version of the original Sportsman's Grill.\n\nThis current Lodge version is actually stronger and better, with several design improvements, than the Original. It's great to see a company acquire an existing product and actually improve its design and build quality, rather than cheapen it. I salute Lodge for actually improving the Original design. The current grills are stronger, are cast thicker, have side carry handles, are more stable and all around improved over earlier versions.\n\nThere's a really well done youTube video in which the 1940 Birmingham version and a modern Lodge version are compared side by side. Lodge has really done a great job maintaining and improving an already excellent design.\n\nThis works great outdoors, but it's also handy if you want a controlled wood fire in your home fireplace, or if you want to be able to actually cook (pots, pans) in your fireplace for Emergency Preparedness. And it's small enough to fit in any working fireplace I can imagine.\n\nThis comes 'pre-seasoned' out of the box, and ready to cook. Like all cast iron it will rust if you leave it out exposed to weather; hygienically the main component you really need to care about is the grill top itself. This is small and easy to move under cover or wrap in a tarp or plastic bag. Lodge sells a custom cover but you can accomplish the same thing with any decent trash bag.\n\nIt's not clear in some photos but this has three legs, because a tripod is stable and can't wobble. The bail is attached, but the front door, the sliding air-intake grate and both the upper and lower grill plates are detachable; just something to remember when moving it around. When I'm going to carry it I put the front door-hatch and sliding air intake cover inside the grill under the lid to prevent losing them. Then I double-bag everything to keep ash inside, with just the bail handle protruding. Easy to do. (The grill still works fine without those doors if you lose them, it just burns hotter without the hatches).\n\nThis is just a great grill. These are available at most big box sports store and discount chains. The older versions are sought after by some collectors. I found a 1940s version at a garage sale recently and it cleaned up beautifully with a wire brush and a little vegetable oil (there are tons of instructions online for restoring old cast iron, and also fan forums).\nIf you have an older pre-1990 version, the modern replacement parts fit perfectly with the vintage versions, which is another nice gesture from Lodge. These really are so solid you can pass them down to the next generation.\n\nJust a great grill in every way. I see these in stores from $70 to $120, and they go on Sale seasonally. This one is #1 in cast iron grills, and it deserves to be. It's just a pleasure to have around.\n\nI hope this review is helpful. Happy grilling!","summary":"A Great Performing Cast Iron Grill With Vintage Nostalgia: 'Sportsman's Grill' by LODGE","unixReviewTime":1422662400,"style":null,"image":null}

This one seemed to have the best reviews, and I suppose I was also swayed by the fact that I've owned a Rapid Reel hose reel for my air compressor hose for a number of years that has proved extremely durable and handy.\n\nIt comes in a remarkably small box given the size of the assembled unit, they did a pretty darn good job on the packaging.  I got mine assembled in about 15-20 minutes, despite my toddler trying to haul off the wheels.  The design is such that the handle always has a bit of flex to it even if you torque down the bolts pretty tight.  I wish that it ended up a bit more rigid, as the flex makes it feel odd.  But otherwise this thing ends up like the tank that I expect from Rapid Reel.  The section of feed hose is very high quality Goodyear hose, the zip tie for holding your hose in the right spot on the reel is very beefy and has a tab so you can loosen\/remove it if needed.\n\nThe unit has a friction brake on it so that gravity doesn't unspool your hose for you.  The friction level is adjustable, but seemed fine with my hose out of the box.  It rolls easily, and doesn't seem to be in any danger of tipping over even if you pull on the hose to get it to unspool.  I pulled at a 90 degree angle from the spool from about 20 feet and the handle conveniently helped align the hose and it unspooled just fine.","summary":"Good quality hose reel","unixReviewTime":1227657600,"style":null,"image":null}

First off, I think it's clever.  Marketing from-seed crops like this in a plantable starter pod is pretty smart.  You've got everything you need to grow a cherry tomato plant in this pod, seeds, of course, growing medium, fertilizer, and a bio-degradable pot which will allow the seedling's roots to spread out.  All you really need to do is take off the cover, plant the pod and keep it moist.\n\nI like the minimal packaging.  Too many things are over-packaged these days.  This gives you exactly what you need.  The instructions included on the cover, are simple but adequate.  I don't honestly see how you could go wrong.  The only thing I'd say is this:  I'm not crazy about Miracle-Gro products.  I prefer organic fertilizers for my garden for a great many reasons -- you can go look up all the information, it's out there.  However I don't see that using these pods would be a huge problem for anyone who isn't a committed organic gardener.","summary":"Clever idea","unixReviewTime":1425600000,"style":{"Style:":" Cherry Tomato"},"image":null}

Waited a few days (shipping \/ store would have to have ordered it anyway) and put it on.  Came with instructions that were very clear (pay attention to the cautions about over-tightening etc...).  While I was at it, I changed the sand out also.  If you want to save a some money, and if you are moderately good with tools (you don't have to be a mechanic) this will work very well.  The most helpful thing I did was to go to Youtube and watch several videos on how to install sand filter valves before the item arrived.  You should do this also.  Since I bought it, it was worked perfectly.  No leaks or issues and my pool is beautiful.

We own a small business that keeps odd hours and we often don't open to the public until late in the day. This intercom system is useful to screen people from the back-office and \"buzz in\" the delivery drivers without significantly interrupting us by having to walk to the front just to turn someone away. Here are my observations:\n\nIncludes: Indoor Unit with Phone Style Handset (it is an intercom, not an actually phone), Outdoor Unit, Mounting Hardware, and Instructions\n\nNot Included:\n* Connection Wire, I used phone wire that we picked up at a local \"Big Box\" store. You will need two wires (1 Pair) for the intercom and another two wires if you want to use the unlocking function (you can get \"2-Pair\" in one cable spool, which is what we used).\n* Optional Electric Door Lock, we already had one on our door but they are sold on Amazon\n\nInstallation:\n* Main Unit - This is desktop or wall mountable, connect the wires to the terminals in the back, one pair for the intercom and (optional) one pair for the lock\n* Outdoor Unit - Mount bracket on wall (ours is well protected from the elements), connect intercom wires to the unit and place in bracket (power is provided from the handset unit)\n* Optional Electric Lock - connect 2nd pair of wires to the lock\n\nUse: This is very straight forward, pressing the button on the outdoor unit alerts the main handset unit and you can clearly hear, and be heard, on both sides of the  conversation. If you have the optional electric door lock, you can press the button on the handset unit and it will allow the door to be opened by the visitor.\n\nThis is a fairly basic unit that works well and is very cost effective.\n\nHighly Recommended!\n\nCFH\n\nNote: sample unit provided to review","summary":"Very Good System - Highly Recommended","unixReviewTime":1407024000,"style":{"Style:":" Waterpipe"},"image":null}

Every time you lower the umbrella at least six of the eight caps that attach to the ribs come off the ribs. (Sometimes all eight of them.) So each time you raise the umbrella you have to re-attach the plastic caps onto the ribs. But that's not the only thing. You can only re-attach the caps with the umbrella in the \"half-way up\" position. (All the way down they fall off. All the way up, it's too tight and you'll rip or break something.) Picture this. One hand holds the umbrella half-way up while the other hand single-handedly tries to re-attach the caps.\nIf you don't mind going through that ritual each time you lower it, it's a very nice \"thatch-look\" umbrella with plenty of \"hair.\"\n\nThis is at the end of the first season:\nAfter four months this summer (May 15 - Sept 15, 2018) the umbrella thatch has deteriorated in the Connecticut sun. (Umbrellas are supposed to be in the sun, aren't they?) With each breeze and\/or rain little strands of the plastic \"thatch\" blow off the umbrella and on to my deck and yard. It has also turned color from tan to neutral taupe. By now, September, I'm very disappointed in this product. It looked good when it arrived (see above paragraph) but now it doesn't.

It isn't going to be a good substitute for a regular garden hose unless you live in a condo or downstairs apartment and are just watering a small flower bed or pots by hand. The good part is the very light weight, especially if you are disabled, arthritic, or both. The bad news is that it has to be babied along, and won't take the kind of treatment a heavy rubber garden hose will.\n\nI have a small yard inside the city. Most of my yard is reachable by soaker hoses, but I have potted plants on my front porch and a small bed nearby that aren't reached by my soaker hoses. Every day in summer I step out, turn on my little 50 foot hose (mine is royal blue), and I water my pots and the little pansies and petunias beside my porch. When I am done, I turn off the hose, hold about half of it upside down to drain it, and then I coil it carefully on top of a plastic crate on the porch (and out of the sun), where it waits for me to do the same thing the next day. Lather, rinse, repeat, right?\n\nI really like the fact that it is so lightweight. The only thing I feel is causing any weight at all on my sore joints is the water inside the hose, and that goes with the territory. We have had temperatures close to 100 degrees, unseasonably hot, and the hose has been fine.\n\nSo the bottom line is to follow the rules:\n\n* drain it every single time\n* don't leave it where it can be stepped on by someone\n* don't drag it across anything prickly like rose bushes with thorns, or pine needles\n*don't put it on a hose hanger\n\nIf all of those are too limited for your purposes, this is not the product you want. I like mine fine, though.","summary":"Perfect for Gentle, Limited Use; Light Weight Great for Disabled and Elderly","unixReviewTime":1437436800,"style":null,"image":null}

You cannot clear up string algae that's already formed either.  Completely remove the string algae  and then start with a clean barley bale  and see what happens.

I had a little difficulty putting the walls into the floor slots because weighing only 140lbs and being 5\"4\" tall made it a little difficult because I just didn't have the weight or force required. Other than this I found it easy to assemble and it's quite roomy on the inside. I store all my garden equipment (including a push lawnmower), tools, seasonal decorations, and I have room for more stuff. I reused 2 shelving units, and a Rubbermaid triangular garden tool organizer that I had in my previous shed (which was eaten up by termites and had to be torn down). It comes with 1 wall to wall shelf, 2 smaller shelves plus, 2 small corner shelves, and 2 strips that hold clips? for somewhat smaller tools. I hang my weed eater and the 100ft electrical cord on these, along with some hand tools\/garden tools. It does now have any electrical outlets in it, so I put up a Mr. Beams battery operated motion detector light on one of the sides of the roof and this seems to be ample enough for finding something at night. It is water tight, that is, I have found no leaks after a heavy rain, and it rains a lot here in Louisiana. I chose to use a base of pea gravel under the flooring, rather than a wooden or cement base, just because it was easier for me and this seems to be working out just fine-I feel it offers a lot of support under the flooring. It has a neat and attractive appearance, although I think the colors are rather drab-like beige walls and dark gray roof and doors. If you need a larger shed, they sell an expansion kit. So far, I love the shed and find it roomy enough for my needs. I would recommend it for anyone who likes \"do-it-yourself\" projects. And even a women can do it. Amazon quotes the shipping weight as 220lbs, but a freight company delivered the shed and they put in on their scales prior to delivery and it weighed 573lb. I mention this because the weight of the delivery determines how many men they send out for delivery of the product. So one man was sent out with the delivery and he struggled a little. Although they weighed the 2 large boxes, they have to go by what the seller tells them-the 220lbs. That's the only glitch in the process-Amazon needs to change their shipping weight to a more accurate account, because the delivery person could have hurt himself, while struggling with the 2 large boxes. Overall, I'm very pleased with the product and would do it all over again, knowing the end results.","summary":"Attractive, almost indestructible shed for a \"do-it-youselfer!","unixReviewTime":1404432000,"style":null,"image":null}

We also tried the Rescue trap, bought locally by a housemate, and it works equally well, at first, but who wants to buy more \"attractant\"?  When I put my recipe (below) in the little cup and added a piece of fried chicken skin\/coating on a 'meat prong', the wasps didn't die.  Apparently, once trapped in the upper portion, they crawl back down to feed on the chicken and take some back to the rest? so I think a trap with liquid in the entire bottom, like the Aspectek, is quicker and more humane.\n\nThe recipe enclosed in the Aspectek traps used \"shot glasses\" for some unfathomable reason so I had to do some math to make a usable recipe.  In the U.S. (only) a shot glass is usually 1 oz.  This feeder holds  cup at most. What works for me is:  2 T sugar, 1 T cranberry juice, 3 T water, 1 T cider vinegar.

It comes with an insulation mat that should be placed underneath the heating mat as a buffer to help prevent heat loss downward. Also has a 6' cord and the dimensions are 10\"x20 3\/4\". Couple things I feel I should point out. According to the item description here on Amazon, it says it's waterproof but in the manual that comes with the mat it says water resistant. Since we're dealing with electricity and water I'd say that's a huge difference. I err on the side of caution and do my best to not get it wet. The next thing is, this mat gets pretty hot when plugged directly into the outlet. I'm talking roughly 110 F degrees hot. If you plan on using this for seed starting and seedlings you're definitely going to want a thermostat to decrease and regulate the heat cause otherwise you'll cook the roots of your young plants. I use a thermostat set at 75F degrees and that works well for me. Since I have had no problems with this mat for two growing seasons yes, I would buy this again.

The 12\" version is perfect so you can just put it on the far right (or left) and then make sure your meats don't drip fat onto the tube to prevent the fire from going out. It produces quite a bit of smoke and makes the meats taste great.\n\nTips if you have a Masterbuilt electric smoker\n1. If you want to get a lot of smoke for 4-5 hours, remove the tray loader and the wood chip tray from the smoker. You'll have a hole on the bottom right from the tray loader but that gives you better airflow and will help burn the pellets, thus producing more smoke.\n2. If you want to get less smoke for 6-7 hours, keep the tray loader inside to prevent more airflow. Since you're limiting the oxygen in the smoker, the pellets will burn at a slower rate since they are producing less smoke.\n3. Don't start this fire inside the smoker; start it outside first and then move it in\n4. Make sure there's no meat placed directly above the tube, otherwise the fire will go out. If you spritz or mop your meat, be careful so it doesn't drip onto the tube.\n5. Don't place the tube directly beneath the heating element. This area is too hot and the pellets will expand and not burn correctly.","summary":"12\" perfect for a Masterbuilt electric smoker.","unixReviewTime":1445299200,"style":{"Color:":" Stainless"},"image":null}

Otis","reviewText":"I actually bought this from Wal**t.com on sale under $400 with free shipping.  Arrived in less than 4 days.  Very happy with that part of purchase. Set it all up in no time by myself....less than an hour.  I used a pool cover pump to transfer water from my nearby pool into the spa.  The pool water is already chemically treated and substantially warmer than water from the hose.  It was filled in about 3 hours.  Turned on the control panel and everything worked!  I was thrilled.  Now I just had to wait for the water temp to get up to 98 or so....which would take overnight.  (2 degress per hour is accurate). Next morning the spa was 98 degrees.  Perfect.  Put on the bubbles......it looked great.  Appeared very impressive on my deck by the pool.  My 8 year old daughter was anxious and wanted to go in....so I let her go in for a little while.  She went back and forth from the pool to the spa...numerous times.  She got out, I turned off the bubbles and put the cover back on.  A little while later I came back outside and heard the control panel beeping.  I went over and the entire control panel was lit up.  No buttons worked.  I reset the panel (basically unplugged it and plugged it back in) and the same thing happened.  All icons on panel lit up, beeping, and buttons unresponsive. My wife and 2 other children wanted to go in.....and here I am all bummed out that the thing is broken.  I called the Intex customer service....and like others who wrote reviews.....was talking with someone who's primary language was not English.  At least I wasn't on hold for more than 5 minutes....and the phone call was over pretty quickly.  She just took my contact info, what the problem was, and told me I would receive an email to file my claim.  I opted to go through Intex first....as I could always return the entire thing to Wal**rt in the future if I have to.  Within 10 minutes I was online and uploaded my receipt an filled out the claim form.  The next day I received an email that I would be shipped a new control panel.  Later in the day...I got a shipment notification and a FedEx tracking number.  VERY impressed with the customer service so far.  The only downfall is that the \"estimated\" delivery date is over a week away.....now I have to decide to drain the spa or not until it arrives.  As for the overall experience......if it eventually works as well as it looks....this will have been, even with this hiccup, a great purchase.  I have purchased Intex products before....having 2 Intex pools and related intex filter pumps....and have been very happy with their products.  Intex is based in California and Canada.....but evidently some, if not all, of their products are imported.  If you read the negative reviews....perhaps the people did not properly follow the instructions when filing a claim, or perhaps Intex knows that Wal**rt is a huge retailer of their products compared to smaller vendors on Amazon...and expedites claims.  Who knows....but there hasn't been any issues with customer service delaying anything for me.  In fact......it only took 1 day to get a FexEx tracking number from my initial claim.  We will see....and I will keep posting to this review as things progress.\n\nUPDATE: a week passed and I got my replacement control unit.  I had drained the spa....so before I replaced the new control unit...I filled it with my pool water as mentioned earlier.  After a few hours it was filled.  I replaced the control unit, plugged it in, pushed the power button and presto!  A loud beeping noise, all the icons lit up, and nothing working.  Reset the control unit numerous times....nothing.  Another call to INTEX customer service...phone call answered promptly, and was over in 5 minutes.  They will be shipping me a control BASE this time as they think the power supply unit or something electrical in the base is causing the issue.  This was yesterday...and I got an email confirmation that my base unit was approved and will be shipped.  If all goes well, I will be getting a shipping confirmation today or tomorrow.  But then the week wait again...and deciding to empty the spa or not once again.  Third time's a charm?  We'll see.  I have a 90-day return policy with WALM**T...so I will play the game for now and keep my fingers crossed.\n\nUPDATE:  been another week and the BASE unit is scheduled to arrive today.  Weird thing is that for some reason I decided to reset the spa last night (I kept the water in it)...and the control panel beeped once and started working!  I \"gently\" pushed the heater control up to 100 degrees...and the filter pump turned on.  I pushed the bubble button and the thing started bubbling!!  I turned off the bubbles and left the thing, checking from my window if it was still lit up every so often.  I went outside before bedtime and the temp said 80 degrees.  It was still going.  This morning I got up, and it had died over the night.  Control panel all lit up and unresponsive.  What a roller coaster....up and down.  I am so anxious for this thing to work.  I will hook up the new BASE tonight and give a final do or die update in the next few days.  Thumbs up....or back to Walm**t. No more chances with Intex customer support.\n\nUPDATE: BASE unit arrived yesterday and I immediately switched it out with the old one. I also attached the new control panel I received last week.  Plugged it in, switched it on and.....everything seems to be working!!  The hum from the base is not as loud as the old one, so maybe that's an indication in a positive direction. Water was at 76 degrees...and I set it to 100....which it was this morning when I checked it.  Still going. Good.  Hopefully this will be my last post.  We will give it a try later today.\n\nUPDATE:  5 days later, and everything working well.  Tub is great, and it looks as good as it feels.  Everyone who sees it wants one. I am keeping my fingers crossed that this will last a few seasons or more.\n\nUPDATE:  Been 3 weeks since I hooked up the replacement BASE unit. Everything working fine. Had to clean the filters about 5 days ago, because of an error code indicating the filters needed cleaning\/replacement. Last night I had my window open and I heard the spa bubbling.  I went outside and sure enough, under the cover, the bubbles were going.  Pushed the \"bubbles\" button numerous times....still going.  Pushed the heat button and they stopped.  Pushed the heat button again and the bubbles turned on. Now the bubbles go on every time the heat is on.  NO GOOD!!!  I reset the breaker, etc., and the same problem.  I have the original control panel and will hook it up later today, but THREE STRIKES YER OUT!!!.  It's only a matter of time this thing will crap out again.  GREAT CONCEPT....but poor quality concerning the electronics on this thing.  Still have over a month to return to WALM**T....but it looks like when I emtpy it for the winter (or the old control unit doesn't work)...it will be making that \"RETURN\" trip.  COLEMAN just started advertising a spa on Amazon.....I may look into that.\n\nFINAL UPDATE: Hooked up the old original control unit and the same thing.  Turn on the heater and the bubbles turn on too. I am so bummed that I am one of the few that isn't having luck with this.....but in the long run, it is probable that the lack of quality concerning the electronics will eventually catch up with a lot of these 5 star reviewers. My spa will be going back to the local Walxxxt in the next few days. Thank heaven for their 90 day return policy. Can't deal with Intex customer service again...even though they will send me new parts....they just crap out.\n\nOk,  Its summer 2015 and Walxxt has it on sale for $329 and free shipping.  I must be crazy...but I ordered another one.  It is sitting boxed in my garage waiting to be set up. Maybe I will be lucky this time around.  It will be set up this weekend and I will post the results. Worst case scenario....another return back to the store.  That's the good thing about purchasing it online from Walmxxt....if there is a problem (within return policy), you just bring it back to your local store,,,,no hassle concerning shipping it back to somewhere.\n\n8\/10\/15:  Set up new spa with no problem.  (Have had much past experience).  Filled with water from hose.  Was up to temperature (100 degrees) by the next morning.  Been going about 4 days now.  Had a BIG pool birthday party for my daughter 2 days ago....kids in and out....many, many people commenting on how cool it is, etc.  So far so good.  I kept my eye on the kids making sure they didn't push buttons too many times, etc., and was yelling at them if they got too rough.  I'm making sure it's babied for a while.  Hopefully my over reaction will diminish the longer it keeps going without issues.  You would think that Intex would beef up their products since there are so many returns.  It costs them an arm and a leg to manufacture and ship out free replacement parts.  Using thicker wire or bigger blower\/heater would help cut back on most of the problems (In my case its all been electronics).  Even if they upped the price $100.\n\n8\/27\/15:  Been going over 3 weeks without issue.  Drained it once and refilled with fresh water as the developed a strange smell. Noted in other posts that the rubber\/laytex sides will leach out a bit since the product is new.  This will go away with time.  New water has been in it for 2 weeks and it is still clear without smell.  Washed filters out last week and will again soon.  Keep a small 1\" tab of clorine in the little floatie and test water every 3\/4 days.  If clorine tests high, i take out floatie for a few days and keep in glass dish by spa.  So far so good on this one.\n\n9\/21\/15:  Still working without issue.  Did note that those who complained about the sides getting slimey were correct.  Even with the chemicals balanced correctly, there is a slight film (rubs off easily) that developes after a period of non-use.  Especially on the bottom of the cover pillow that makes contact with the water.  Not sure how to correct that problem....but can live with it for now......a quick brushing and its gone.\n\n10\/15\/15:  The spa is still working fine.  Getting colder outside, and my pool is covered for the season, so I guess this is a wrap for now.  Time to empty it and put it away.  Will report back next spring.\n\nFebruary, 2017:  Sorry for not getting back sooner!  Spa got set up in late Spring of 2016.  After inflating and filling with water, turned on the unit and everything lit up correctly.  After I pushed the circulation button....nothing.  After a few seconds got that familiar beeping noise with the code that indicated pump was not working.  Tried a few times.....still nothing.  I decided not to panic...and let it sit.  After a day or two, I turned on the unit, pushed the circulation button and to my surprise....the pump started working!!  Turned on the heater and had no problems at all for the rest of the season.  I'm thinking that slight corrosion over the winter prevented the impellers from moving and caused the problem. After sitting for a few days, the water loosened up the impeller.  I think.  Who knows. At any rate, the spa worked flawlessly for almost 4 months until I packed it away in September.  Keeping fingers crossed for next season.\n\nFinale' 8\/5\/2017:  Got it out for 2017 season....everything prepared to inflate it.  Control unit turned on and inflated the tub to the correct pressure. Didn't start filling it with water as I didn't have time.  Returned later in the day and the damn thing was deflated.  Checked everything, hooked back pump and reinflated it. A few hours pass and its soft again.  It's out to the curb. Good riddance.","summary":"Made in China.  Decide accordingly.

This is what I did and know.  After trying different traps, repellents, noise solar stake and even took a shot at it with a pellet gun (at which the activity resume after 6 days) nothing worked.  I bought this as a last resort before calling a professional.  I used a stick about 1\/2x1\/2\"x5' and tapered the tip (not sharp) just enough to penetrate the ground,  Where ever I felt soft ground under my feet, I use the stick to see if its a tunnel.  If you have mounds (I removed the mounds daily to monitor activity and not kill the grass that got buried,) try between mounds.  If your stick drops suddenly around 2\" after penetrating the top soil, you hit a tunnel. As desperate as I was, whether active or inactive, I poured a teaspoon of the Moletox through the hole made by the stick. I did the same for the next two days.  The activity stopped on the fourth day and had been for more than 3 weeks as of this review.\n\nIf you read as much as I did on gopher (pocket,)  you'll read that they won't eat bait because they taste first prior to eating, they gather food in their pocket (their cheeks thus the name pocket gopher) and put it in their food storage and lastly, poison takes 4 to 5 days to take effect and steady consumption.  So this is why I use this product last, because it shouldn't work.  I did however got result, because of it or not I don't know since I have no proof.\n\nIf you don't have a stick laying around, you can spend $30 for the Yard Butler bait applicator.","summary":"Haven't seen any gopher activity in 3 weeks after application.","unixReviewTime":1394496000,"style":null,"image":null}

(Hey, off-season price was $35 less!)  I contacted the seller because upon testing I could smell a funny burning odor.  They assured me this was normal and due to the friction around the rubberized blades.  Well this morning we had a sufficient amount of snow here in MD for me to try it out.  The handle folded out easily and I was ready to go within  a couple of minutes.  The thrower worked without any trouble with snow as little as 1 inch and as much as 6 inches including some wetter snow with bits of ice.\nMy only complaints: The mechanism for turning this on is a pain.  I have to press a button WHILE moving the bar against the handlebar.  Hmm, yeah I'll be modifying this at some point.  Second complaint: the power cord on the thrower has a BIG circular cup over it making it impossible for me to use a cord mating device to cover and keep the extension cord connected.  I had to hold the extension cord for tension relief instead of being able to use a cord cover.  I may trim it down or zip-tie it to the frame.\nOverall this thrower worked very well for it's first real-world test.\n\nUpdate 2\/15\/2014\nI simply had to post an update about this snow thrower.  I have been truly impressed with this little snow beast, and have been able to amaze others to where at least one is going to buy one of their own!  I've given this thing HEAVY use over the past few days attacking powdery snow, wet snow, slush, and clumps of packed snow\/sleet.  Other than tripping the circuit breaker a couple of times (solely my error) this Power Smart snow thrower has performed wonderfully!  I used it this morning to help clear snow\/slush\/packed snow from a 150x45' parking area for a local church and kept up VERY well with a two-stage gas-powered snow blower.  This snow thrower is in my top-ten list of good purchased for 2013!  My only tip to everyone - check and tighten the blades after every 2-3 hours of use especially if you've attacked any packed snow.","summary":"Updated: Now 5 Stars!!","unixReviewTime":1388707200,"style":null,"image":null}

It looks much nicer in person than in the photo.\nIts simple, casual design will withstand changing trends in furniture styles.\n\nA note concerning all-weather, resin wicker: It is  meant to look like natural wicker, but is made of a synthetic material that  requires little maintenance. It is  durable, strong, resistant to humidity, water & UV radiation, & somewhat elastic which adds to the chair's comfort. It's easy to clean & can be hosed down (remove the cushions first). The color is part of the fiber & shouldn't fade.\n\nThe chair arrives carefully packaged in a large box with no assembly required.\n\nThe Griffen Chair appears to be well-made, with attention to detail. Constructed with an aluminum frame & feet, the chair is lightweight & strong. The aluminum frame & feet are neatly finished with a dark-brown powder coating. The cushions & throw pillow have zippered, 100% polyester, fabric covers; all of them have piping. The back & seat cushions consist of a  2\" block of foam covered by polyester fiber which brings the total width of each cushion to 4\".  In addition to under-seat webbing which allows the seat to move comfortably,  there's a curved piece of aluminum for additional strength & safety. (see the photo I uploaded)\n\nThe back has a slight slope to it so you're not sitting straight up & down.  The included throw pillow can be arranged to give your back  lumbar support if you need it. I'm 5' 3\" and need to use the pillow so that I don't sit so far back in the chair. My feet even touch the floor when I use the pillow. Because there's a lot of seat depth, I'm assuming a taller person can sit comfortably in this chair too. I will be sure to update my review when one of our taller friends tries it out.\n\nApproximate seat measurements:\nSeat cushion: 25\" long (front to back) x 23.5\" wide (side to side) x 4\" thick.\nBack cushion: 17\" long (up & down) x 23.5\" wide (side to side) x 4\" thick.\nPillow: 17\" square\nSeating area using both seat cushion & back cushion: 23 1\/2\" wide x 22\" - 21\" deep or less depending on how you place the back cushion.\n\nAmazon's product description covers cushion care & cleaning so I won't go into that. However, I will remind you that during inclement weather it's recommended  to bring both the chair and the cushions indoors or securely cover them,  and to store them in a dry place when not in use.\n\nThis is the most comfortable wicker chair I've ever sat in.  It's roomy,  doesn't cut the circulation off in my legs (at the back of my knees), the cushions aren't lumpy, they're comfortable. The chair arms are smooth & not scratchy. I can rest my arms or my elbow on them without causing myself any discomfort.\n\nI will update my review if the Strathwood Griffen chair fails to perform as expected.\n\nA product guarantee isn't mentioned. However, you may return this item sold by Amazon.com within 30 days of delivery for a full refund. Amazon.com will pay the return shipping cost if the return is a result of their error.\n\nUPDATE:\nI've been using this chair indoors on a protected porch so I can't comment on how it withstands the weather.","summary":"Comfortable & roomy","unixReviewTime":1331942400,"style":null,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61IfKwvywoL._SY88.jpg"]}

Adair","reviewText":"Dear Sir\/Madam,\n\nAfter two weeks of using your products, I must say I am extremely dissatisfied. We have one or two mice in our apartment, and I have used four of your products, all to no avail.\n\nFirst we used the no-kill traps, baiting them with peanut butter. The mice were able to eat the bait without being trapped.\n\nThen we tried to trap them using good old-fashioned snap traps. Well, neither so good nor so old-fashioned, it seems.\n\nYour weird improvements (the faux-cheese \"tray\" that serves no discernible purpose, the adjustable sensitivity) do not help at all. Again, the pests are able to eat the bait right off of the trap without triggering the trap. That is, they're eating the peanut butter I've placed there. The Tom Cat Brand bait, that which comes in the small white plastic bottle, doesn't attract them at all, and they've left it to grow hard and stuck to the trap.\n\nAnd as far as sticking goes, my sister-in-law, visiting from overseas, had the pleasure of seeing a mouse (there has only ever been one, maybe two, with scant droppings found) step onto one of your glue traps. Her scream alerted me and I came running, only to watch the pest easily extricate itself from the glue (!) and run away to hide.\n\nI am beyond disappointed. We now feel we have no choice but to hire a professional exterminator, only because, for some strange reason, your traps are not effective. It is really maddening, frustrating, and just plain disappointing that a simple thing like a mouse trap has been rendered ineffectual by your tinkering.\n\nThe lack of sufficient tack on the glue trap is also severely disappointing, but I suppose most maddening of all is the fact your \"specially formulated\" attractant does anything but attract mice. I thought by using it I was pulling out all the stops for what I perceived to be a rather minor issue. In the end it was probably the most egregious waste of money among those listed herein (even at under three bucks).\n\nThese products are all non-returnable, thus my only recourse is write you this note. I'll also be sure to post this same review to your Amazon product pages.\n\nI do hope you take this complaint seriously.\n\nSincerely,\n\nG Adair","summary":"Open letter to Tomcat regarding their poor quality products.","unixReviewTime":1407369600,"style":{"Size:":" 4-Pack"},"image":null}

I have heard horror stories of the snap traps not killing the mice instantly and the creature struggling in agony until finally it dies.  I guess it comes down to do you REALLY want to get rid of an infestation of mice in your home.  This product will help you do it and quickly!  The old snap traps where you have to bait the trap and wait for the little guy to come and feed has been laughable sometimes.  You work hard to put the peanut butter or cheese or whatever concoction on the little 'table' and set the trap up and wait.  Late into the night, the little guy comes by for a snack, carefully eats the food you have left him and goes on his way.  How many times do you feed the mice before you actually catch them?\n\nWith the Tomcat glue traps that doesn't happen.  You sit the glue trap tray in a location where you have seen or heard evidence of the creatures and you wait.  As soon as the mouse or to be honest, any other pest crawls across the surface it is trapped.  The sticky firm glue keeps the creature from moving off of the trap and you have them.  These traps can be easily removed and disposed of once you have captured your mouse.\n\nLast fall, I bought a bag of bird seed and put it in the garage.  I forgot to put it in the storage bin and before I knew it, I had provided a buffet for all of the field mice that could get into our garage.  After laying out Tomcat glue traps we were quickly able to catch the mice.  Now, I keep a few of the traps in the garage just in case one of the little guys tries to enter the garage looking for a warm place to sleep on a cool night or a place to get out of the rain.\n\nI would recommend these traps to anyone that has heard little scurrying feet in the middle of the night and wants to deal with the issue.","summary":"Does a great job!","unixReviewTime":1411084800,"style":{"Size:":" 1 Pack (4 Boards)"},"image":null}

If that is a concern, the pump can be mounted outside of the reservoir thus eliminating any heat transfer directly to the water. Also, there is no possibly of the sealed pump leaking any oil into your nutrient solution and contaminating the system. Highly recommended.","summary":"Great little pump for hydroponics","unixReviewTime":1378944000,"style":{"Size:":" 1000 GPH"},"image":null}

That being said, there are a couple of things you need to know.  The wings on the fairy slide on and therein lies the rub; the area on the wings where they slid into place cracked after a couple of months.  To keep the wings on, I had to use superglue.  I had my fairy outside and she did just fine sitting on a fountain, looked great.  When I got a new fountain, she didn't fit on it and I set her down closer to the ground on a box.  Came home one day and she had fallen over, breaking into several (irreparable) pieces.  If you're going to put her outside, just know you may be taking your chances.  I also sprayed her with sealant, which I read was recommended, and it ruined the finish of the fairy.  My advice is to keep her inside or someplace where she isn't going to blow over or fall over.","summary":"Very Pretty, Some Problems","unixReviewTime":1446768000,"style":{"Style:":" Single"},"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71inp28NxkL._SY88.jpg"]}

MY MAJOR ISSUE and the reason I would not buy this container again:  After 2 months of use this summer, the lid has warped slightly...enough to the point that, now every time when I want to close the lid, I have to put pressure on the right side of the lid first, then push the middle part down to completely close the lid.  If I don't that, the lid will be slightly open and water will seep in or allow bugs to enter. I have to constantly check if the lid is closed because when the kids (8-9 yrs old) try to close it, they can't completely close it cause the lid is warped.  This is an issue cause the kids open the box every time they swim.

In that time, I've had an opportunity to evaluate both the quality of the product and the overall usability. In creating this review I've considered both the type of material used in making the product as well as the overall fit and finish. I've also considered how well the product meets my needs and whether there are any shortcomings or particular advantages in using this product.\n\nFor this particular product, the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality. One must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer. I think for this product that balance has been met fairly well and I believe that the product will meet the expectations of most buyers.\n\nWith regard to the fit and finish of this particular product, I believe it to be about average for the products of similar make or style. That is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanship\/finish nor is it something that I would rate as outstanding. The quality of the piece is such that I feel it is a good value for the money.\n\nFinally, as with many products of this type, the value that a consumer sees is dependent on the expectation. When I ordered this product my expectations were moderate, especially because of the price. In an age where we demand low price but often want high quality, it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead. I did that with this product as was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality was at least good, if not just a tad bit better than good. For that reason, and those set out above, I'd make a recommendation to buy this product.\n\nNOTE: I received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for the promise to file an honest and unbiased review. To meet that obligation, I typically use the product for an extended period, no less than two weeks, and under the typical conditions that one might use for a product of this type.","summary":"I love this product.

Vincent","reviewText":"This was not my first choice for a tow behind dethatcher.  I was look at these three brands Craftsman, Agri-Fab, and Brinly Hardy 48-inch Dethachers.  The Agri-fab and Craftsman dethatcher need to add weight(two cement blocks) to work proper and for that reason I chose not go with those two brands.  The Brinly DT-48H Tow Behind Dethatcher(built in the USA!!!!!) was the only Tow Dethatcher where no added weight is needed to work properly.  The assembly was not too bad but if you have no experience with assembling large mechanical items I would not recommend this product( for a novice, the assembly can be challenge).  After the assembly, the DT-48H is solidly built it will not fall apart( make sure to tighten all those nuts)and will last a long time.  Before you take this lawn dethatcher on your lawn you must place the dethatcher(connected to lawn tractor) on a flat surface to perform a towing arm level check.  Once that is done you are really to begin dethatching your lawn.  I could not believe the amount of dead grass, moss, and other organic material that was coming up.  My grass looks a lot better for it.  If you are in the market for an excellent tow behind dethatcher look no further and get the Brinly DT-48H.  What a great buy!!!!!!  One last thing, watch the package of this item.  My box was open the three plastic ring to keep the box together were to big and did not do their job.  I was missing a total of four parts.  I called Brinly customer service(do not call Amazon for missing parts) told the operate what parts was  missing and two days later my missing parts were at my door(Fedex delivery).","summary":"Great product that actually works!!!!!!","unixReviewTime":1399852800,"style":null,"image":null}

Had a couple of wooden feeders that got chewed up. (Not by squirrels. Raccoons ate one.) Squirrels figure it out soon enough, but stellar jays can't. Bought some copper mesh to replace the plastic window if it broke (after reading other reviews). So far, 3 months in, the plastic has held up to multiple attacks from jays and slow-learning squirrels. I did have to do a few modifications: 1)I put some heavy stick-on felt under the lid in spots so it didn't slam down so loudly. It frightened the squirrels and woke me up on days the critters were having breakfast before I got up. I also taped a stick in it to hold the lid up an inch or so to help the smaller squirrels lift it up. I've mounted the feeder on a railing, so the squirrels have something to stand on when they open it. This may be why it's held up better than other reviews indicated. I'd recommend you put a little platform for the squirrels to stand on when they lift the lid. This thing holds about 2+ pounds of peanuts in the shell, so the supply lasts longer than other feeders I've had.","summary":"Great feeder.

The velcro opening on the top was perfect for adding sand. I put 50 lb bag  on my out building floor about 1 1\/2 ft off the ground. I used a funnel with large opening at top and cut the bottom of funnel off to make length and opening fit my purpose. I situated the premier bad under the corner of the sand bag and then cut off the corner of bad and let sand drain into the bag. I could move funnel side to side to help distribute and also easily controlled flow of sand. I put about 75 lbs in the premier bag. I put umbrella base in its position then fitted it through the center hole of the premier sand anchor. I used stakes to anchor base to the ground and the used a large measuring cup and hand filled the remaining sand into the premier sand anchor.

That's about all I can say about this product for a couple of reasons. First, I followed all the directions with two remotes and everything linked up correctly.  I laid them flat on the counter so they could calibrate their temperatures.  The two remotes both read 70.5 whereas the main unit read 71.8.  I let them sit for about 30-45 mintues but the wall unit never quite seemed to match what the other two units were reading.  I can only assume the other two remotes were accurate because they did match up correctly\/  The wall unit is not accurate, it seems to be hot by 1-3 degrees depending on the day.  The remote functions seem to be accurate, and I honestly care most about this feature.  I have one remote down in my chicken coop and one on my house on the north side under the eave.  The chicken coop is a good 100 feet away from the unit.  They appear to still be accurate, but I have yet to compare with a mercury tube. The battery cover is poorly designed and cheap.  It feels as if it could just slip off the back of the remotes from gravity alone.  Overall I am happy with what I got as it helps me monitor the two outside temps, but I did buy this with the intentions of having three accurate readings not just 2.  So I guess they are firing at 66% for me.","summary":"It's OK","unixReviewTime":1454025600,"style":{"Color:":" La Crosse Technology"},"image":null}

I had been trying various plant foods (feeding sticks, pellets, etc.) but getting pretty limited and unsatisfactory results with most of them. I could keep the plants going, but they just never recovered their original gorgeous appearance. I had also used the non-concentrate version of Miracle-Gro with better results, but one very quickly goes through a bottle and the cost goes up considerably. Finally, this season I decided to give the All Purpose concentrate a try and I have been amazed. For the first week or two I saw little difference and was becoming disappointed, but after that the changes started appearing. All the plants are thriving, blooming as they did when first purchased and looking gorgeous, all for very little cost. You simply have to be willing to periodically mix a third of a capfull in a couple gallons of water and you are off to the races. I have since purchased several more bottles and will be using this from now on. The cost is very reasonable and the benefits and results are terrific. I even tried this on an orchid that had not bloomed in months (I did not have any specific orchid food), and even that is looking fantastic.

Assembly is easy, it takes about 5 minutes requiring only a Philips screwdriver. Initially, you have to charge the battery for 5 hours, then 4 hours each subsequent time. On my first charge I got about 30 minutes of run time, which was enough to skim the pool twice, two days apart. I'm used to only getting about 10 minutes run time out of an r\/c car so I thought the run time was pretty good. The net does a good job of catching most everything floating on the surface and it is easy to remove and empty, just don't reverse both motors with the net in because it will quickly blast everything you picked up back into the pool!\n\nOne thing I noticed is when running full forward or backward the props create a whirlpool that makes them cavitate; I'm not sure if that's bad for these little motors or not. It is especially noticeable if you are running the boat without the net installed. I think a little bit of extra weight on the motors would solve this problem, I'll try it and report back.\n\nOverall I am very pleased with this product, it is a lot of fun to use and serves a purpose at the same time!

For those not familiar with this product here is a quick lesson: You put chlorine or Baquacil in your pool to kill algae and other \"stuff\". Algae eats phosphates which are naturally occurring from dead skin cells from your body, junk from the air, and more. This product removes those phosphates from your pool thus leaving no food for the algae. If algae has no food, it can't live, thus reducing the amount of chlorine or Baquacil needed and leaving you with a sparkling easy maintenance pool.\n\nIf you have never used this product before here is a quick step by step process:\n1. Ensure all chemicals are in balance (PH, Hardness, Alkalinity, etc)\n2. Vacuum the pool like you have never cleaned it before. Trust me, take your time and get the whole pool clean.\n3. Add product as described.\n4. Run the pump for 24 hours min\n\nAfter 24 hours you may notice a cloud fog to show up in the bottom of the pool. No worries, this is a bunch of dead phosphates and they just need time to get cleared out by the filter. I tried to vacuum them out but they are so small they went straight through my sand filter.  I added earth to the filter (yes you can add earth to a sand filter) and this caught a lot of the cloud, but it also immediately plugged the filter and I had to change the earth 4-5 times. If you stay on a regular basis and add this product about 2 times a year you won't have the cloud problem.\n\nI highly recommend this product.

The insole is sheepskin, the uppers are leather, including the shaft (I contacted Bearpaw to verify this).  They are cozy and soft inside, and you don't have to wear them with socks to stay warm.  The strap across the back top of the boot is just a design element - it does not have a snap or Velcro, it is sewn in place.  There are also outer boot pulls but not inner ones, though you don't really need either since the boots have an inside side nylon zipper.  The design is on trend and the slight curve to the back of the boot with the upper strap is flattering to the leg.  It's nice to have a boot that is both stylish enough to wear out, and warm enough to wear outside  :)  Please note that these are warm, fall\/winter boots - because of the plush linings and the thicker sole, they have a heavier profile than standard leather dress boots but they are not snow boots, either.  There is texture to the soles for some grip, but the soles are not lug style or overly thick.  I wouldn't stand in snow or on ice with them for very long.\n\nBearpaw sizing can be iffy sometimes but the Nia's run true to size and are completely comfortable right out of the box.  They're not a very stiff leather boot and won't require a breaking in period.  The toe cap is raised slightly and rounded so your toes aren't cramped.  Bearpaw seems to have taken the plush linings and the sheepskin insole into consideration when doing the sizing on the Nia boot so that you can order your regular size and still have room for thin socks or tights without having to size up.  As for the boot shafts I have average calves, maybe a tad on the heavier side of average, and these fit comfortably with my (not so skinny) jeggings tucked inside.\n\nThe Nia's are really nice looking \"in person\", though I would have liked a better finish to the leather.\n\nUPDATE:  I originally ordered these in Chocolate and when I received them, they had some black spotting (dye?) on the inside side of one boot.  I really loved the fit\/feel of them and since it wasn't extremely noticeable when wearing, decided to keep them.  As a matter of fact, I even ordered a 2nd pair in Black.  But when I received the black ones, they had white-ish marks on the boots, almost like bleach stains.  After having ordered 2 pair and receiving both defective, I am sending the black ones back.  This is not an Amazon problem, it is a quality control problem within Bearpaw because the stains on the black ones were so bad they could not have been missed if they had been inspected before packaging.  I would still rate the boots themselves as 5 star, but I am very disappointed in Bearpaw and their lack of quality control.","summary":"Best of Both Worlds","unixReviewTime":1384300800,"style":{"Color:":" Repeller1116"},"image":null}

Once they swell up to about a nickle size, I integrated them into the soil of my container garden. Well a few days later, we had about 3-4 days of heavy rain. Next thing I know, I see the monster-sized gooey things on the ground and at the top of the container. The containers have plenty of drain holes, but I guess all of the heavy rain just super charged the crystals' sizes. I mean they push straight up through several 5 gallon buckets. I put the crystals about midway in the buckets about where I thought the roots may grow.\n\nAfter a couple of very hot days, the ones on the ground and on the top of the buckets just lost all of their form and liquidized into this plasma-looking flat blob.\n\nI used my hand and pulled out as much of it as I could from the rest of my buckets. As they were pushing their way up through the soil, they know out a whole lot soil. So, I just did not wish to go through that again during the next heavy rain. Also after seeing the gooey blog that they turned in to when exposed to the sun, I just decided I did not wish for that gunk to be in with food I was going to eat!!!\n\nFor a cool-looking project to do with kids, I would likely give this item about a 4-star rating; however, for my purposes, it just did not fit the bill. I can't say that these crystal won't help the soil hold or put moisture into the soil. However, I can't say that they will either. I will say that (1) based on the size that these crystals can get, a 10 lb bucket will go a very long way in terms of relative size. (2) I originally was going to put these into a raised bed but decided not to tackle that this year...so maybe they would work better in a larger area (3) If you do use them for gardening, remember a little goes a long way...or at least don't let their tiny initial size fool you to how big they can potentially get when exposed to a lot of moisture like rainstorms, especially for a container garden.\n\nBecause I have so much of the stuff (almost 18 lbs) left, I am thinking about trying a very small amount in some containers and plants some flowers. If they pan-out in that application, I will certainly update this review and be fair!!!","summary":"Crystals Hold Water But Not Sure If It Keeps Soil Moist","unixReviewTime":1371772800,"style":null,"image":null}

The bar and chain are of comparable quality to the ones on my gas-driven 'ranch size' chain saws.  The low-kickback design features are important to safe use of chain saws.  I like the window for seeing bar oil level. With my big saws there is no way to do that conveniently.  Weight is reasonable at eight pounds or so but the unit will 'feel' heavier the farther the pole is extended from the handle.  Short persons with short arms who are not normally physically active will not find the physics of this unit to be comfortable for long periods of sawing.  The younger and stronger an adult you are, the more you will like working with this unit.\n\nEarly reviews of this saw are good on information.  Some conclusions depend on point of view.  The oval extender profile is good in comparison to a hypothetical round pole but I prefer the 'stirrup' type of 'u' shaped bar attachment, such as the ones on my gas-powered trimmers, for better leverage and control.  It is also very important not to over-extend the pole and equally important to really twist down on the extension locking ring to prevent rotation of the cutting head during use.\n\nAs to the 'electric' part of this system:  6.5 amps seems to be fine for light trimming and pruning.  An electric saw can be as dangerous as a gas model.  Maybe this tip comes more from the 'Legal Department' at Black and Decker but they recommend using a circuit with a Ground Fault Interrupter built in.  This is not a commonly found feature of outside electrical outlets.  Care must be taken not to overload a circuit and heavy duty, double insulated extension cords will also be necessary.  Those are just a few of the points raised in the owner\/operator's manual that comes with the unit and it is a manual that should be read carefully and followed closely.\n\nThe 'crunch' in rating this power tool is how often it will get used and how far out your extension cords will reach and how much higher it will reach.  My experience is that the saw will only reach four-to-five feet over your shoulder height.  The manual cautions that the control switch should stay below shoulder level during operation.  Stringing 'endless' power cords out into the yard costs power as distance increases and not every home has as many perimeter power outlets as mine does.  This is not the tool to use for 'felling' even saplings.  It is for shaping by working on unwanted branches or for removing dead or damaged lower limbs on young trees or shrubs.  Soon enough the typical home owner will have done all that is needed in that line to every reachable tree or shrub in the yard.  Then the tool will sit around until a neighbour asks to borrow it.","summary":"Four Stars for Design; Execution.

I said \"really there's no other way?  So I have to take a day off of work for a stupid delivery.\"  Their delivery terminal said \"yes that's correct.\"  No explanation, no apology.

There's no way for them to be responsible for mistakes as long as the people purchasing these products need to work.\n\nUPDATE:  It's now going on 4 weeks since I made my order, and the shipper has lost the package, and beyondnice is still going back and forth with me deciding whether to make another one.  Sometimes, ESPECIALLY when it comes to custom, made-to-order products, it's all about the customer experience.  In this case, an awful customer experience.","summary":"Do not order from this company:  Buyer beware","unixReviewTime":1370390400,"style":null,"image":null}

And, of course, the container is designed to easily dispense this mixture from waist height or close to the ground.

I splurged to buy the pole saw because I really needed it and all the reviews seemed to indicate it was the best among competitors, albeit MUCH more expensive.

It's been a month now and the weather was warm for a while so I think that helped the rug to lose the folded shape it came in.

I did use these traps indoors, so I'm not sure how effective they are when used outdoors.\nThe traps were great for trapping the adult whiteflies, thereby keeping them from multiplying further, but I also took some advice I found online and washed each of the infested plants with plenty of soapy water to get rid of eggs and larva that were stuck to the underside of the leaves. You have to really get in there and rub each leaf individually with soapy water and then rinse well, because the eggs that they lay are very sticky and you want to remove all of that stuff before they hatch. I used dishwashing detergent and even though it was a pain, I was able to get rid of those nasty bugs that were killing my plants.\n\nSo the traps didn't singlehandedly solve my problem, but they absolutely helped. They do what they're supposed to do, but I recommend a good washing of the plants if you're serious about getting rid of these pests.\n\nThis package of 15 was a really good value. I assumed I would get 15 strips or whatever, but I got 15 large sticky traps that were more than enough to spread throughout the apartment around all of my plants, and I still have some left over, which hopefully I will not have to use.

The jetter's plastic coating makes it slippery and easy to push through the sewer line and it is light in weight.  Instead of turning on my pressure washer at the start I turned it on after I had pushed the jetter hose all the way in.  Then I turned on the pressure washer and slowly pulled out the jetter.  Worked like a charm!!  Unlike a metal snake the clean-up of the jetter hose was a breeze.  To be fair, a couple of days before I used the jetter I put in two bottles of lye based sewer line cleaner, thru the vent line, to turn the oil and grease into soap.  I'm sure this helped the cleaning of the sewer line.  The hose is now sitting in my tool shed waiting for it's next job.","summary":"Never go back to the old fashion metal snake!","unixReviewTime":1484352000,"style":null,"image":null}

I've seen their well-worn trails around the base of my foundation, along my fence posts, and under my wood pile. I've also learned (through the internet) that they really like to live in rotten wood, and they are more active at dusk. One evening, I went out at dusk and sprinkled some of this stuff all along those trails and put a little extra near the places where I suspected their colonies to be. I came back to check on them a few minutes later and discovered that they had immediately swarmed the bait and had started carrying it back home. It was amazing to watch the ants go after this stuff - they were quite enthusiastic about it! In fact, their swarming action helped me identify several more potential colonies and I was able to put down even more bait to target those specifically. When I went out to look again the next morning, the bait was pretty much all gone except for a few straggler ants pulling in the last few crumbs. Haven't seen much in the way of ant activity since then! Great product.","summary":"Ants love it","unixReviewTime":1470096000,"style":null,"image":null}

Mine was sheared off at the fitting right out of the box.  Lucky for me that I had some 1\/4\" gas copper coil and a flare tool,  I replaced that line.  When replacing, I found that the aluminum line was easy to break.  A slight twist and the other end of the line broke at the opposite fitting.\n\nYou'd thing for $2500+ dollars, Weber would use use better materials than aluminum for gas lines,  The copper line I used will now last as long as the grill.

I like the 4 vents for regulating heat. The cheaper competition often does not have much (if any) heat regulation options. My issue with this grill is it is very pricey for what you get, considering many big box hardware stores brands are 1\/3 the price with more features and a larger size.  It would be nice if the base clamped to the body and had side handles like some of the competition. The built in thermometer is nearly useless. It reads 75 to as much as 150 off reality. In looking on the internet, it seems the grilling world is well aware of the poor quality of that part. For what this unit costs,  an even moderately reliable thermometer does not seem like too much to ask for.  It would be nice to have a hinge or hanging hook for the hood as well. 3rd party kits are available, but I would rather not hack up the unit right out of the box.\n\nMy history with Weber grills has been exceptional, so it 'might' well be worth the extra $, only time will tell.

It's because they add something like linseed oil to the ribbon, which acts as an attractant (has kindof a sour smell). But it appears they recently changed their formula to have less smell (and less attractant), probably due to customer complaints about smell. Argh.\n\nI found an old box of Pic ribbons, and hung an old one next to a newer one - the old one caught twice as much. Regardless, even the new Pic catches more than any of the others we've tested (Raid, Victor, Catchmaster, etc etc).\n\nThis 30-pack is a great deal, currently $6 Prime. I hung one in the kitchen last night because we've had fuit flies hanging around, and the Raid strip I hung there hadn't caught anything. Overnight, it caught 14 fruit flies (didn't even know I had that many), AND a moth AND a mosquito!\n\nI can't vouch for different insects in different parts of the country (I'm writing in the midwest). But in my experience, the Pic catches anything that flies - moths, flies, gnats, fruit flies, mosquitos, even wasps.\n\nFor price... Walmart used to carry these at $2.88 per 10-pack. So I consider anything under 30 each a good price.

I regularly use the gloves and claws when cooking (not just BBQ). The flexible grilling skewers, grilling mat and injector are nice, but I don't know that I will use them often.\n\nI really like the silicone gloves - I've been using cloth Cuisinart mitts forever, but they are horrible - you can't hold hot things for too long, can't get the fingers wet, and they get dirty easily. Silicone gloves are awesome!! I picked up a steak with the gloves to turn them over on the BBQ grill! When I roasted a chicken in my oven, I didn't have to worry about getting the thumb into the juices in the pan. What a relief. The gloves fit awkwardly though, the fit isn't anything like normal gloves. I'm guessing this makes it easier for all sized hands to wear? I don't really know. But they fit me fine, and I usually wear Large for Women's gloves.\n\nThe claws are handy: I used them for carving a huge slab of meat, as well as a chicken.\n\nThe injector unfortunately comes sealed in that crappy plastic case so I haven't bothered to open it yet because I already have a plastic one that I use. If you have never used a syringe before for your turkey.. DO IT!! I normally hate turkey at Thanksgiving and think its bland and boring, but using a syringe full of fresh herbs and juice will make your turkey MOUTHWATERING DELICIOUS. I could eat that everyday!\n\nI also have not used the black thin mats because I like to have grill marks on my food. I will probably never use them, but they are nice a large.\n\nThe flexible metal grilling skewers are neat, but I don't know if I will ever cook enough to use them (I usually only cook for 2 people). If I ever entertain a large party for BBQ, I will definitely use them to marinate and grill large amounts of food. How convenient they must be to marinate and easily fold into a large tupperware for marination!\n\nHope my review helps and happy shopping.","summary":"Nice BBQ set - gloves & claws useable for everyday cooking too","unixReviewTime":1445040000,"style":{"Size:":" Set of 6"},"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71ZsWaZhL0L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/716UERkCEVL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71JyppBQN8L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71qaVJ52C4L._SY88.jpg"]}

Setup was very easy, taking about 20 minutes to get the pieces out of the box, get the handle onto the frame, screwing on some hoses, and adding oil and fuel.  No tools were required, so even the most unskilled person could get this thing working easily.\n\nThe instructions remind you in multiple places never to start without having your water hooked up and turned on, so as long as you follow the setup instructions, it shouldn't be a problem getting the washer working.  Mine started on the first pull, which is pretty impressive.\n\nThis model of Generac comes with 4 wand tips, ranging from a cleaning solution tip to a 0 degree \"blast\" tip.  I paired mine up with a Karcher T350 surface cleaner (rated at 2650 psi, so use at your own risk), and it worked great cleaning my driveway.  It made a normally 2 to 4 hour job a 45 minute job, plus it didn't leave streaks or areas where I missed.\n\nThe large wheels and upright orientation make the pressure washer easy to move around, and the placement of the hose connectors made it easy NOT to accidentally get the hose up against the hot engine (a cause of failure in other models).  This Generac also comes with a detergent reservoir, although since I didn't use it, I can't say how well it works.\n\nBottom-line for me:  this is an affordable power washer that does the job.  It cost me less than what I would have paid a professional, it accepted an inexpensive surface cleaner attachment, and it's powerful enough to get a dirt and moss encrusted driveway clean.  I can't speak to long-term reliability, but I will update if there are any significant changes in performance.","summary":"Easy to use and very powerful","unixReviewTime":1397174400,"style":{"Style:":" 2,800 PSI"},"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/718fOR-tffL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61eNDtKSZbL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Pyw32WEqL._SY88.jpg"]}

It might be used to cover a birdbath or the upper part of an outdoor fountain during winter months, for example.  I bought the 60-inch round cover.\nWhat I like about it:\n1.  It's a basic beige color, and the fire pit stays unnoticed off to the side until it's wanted.\n2,  It is waterproof.  Dew and rain bead up and roll off it.\nNote: It is NOT fireproof or fire resistant, so of course you need to be sure the fire is completely out and the ashes are cold before you cover the fire pit.\n3.  It's lightweight and easy to adjust; because it is lightweight, it folds neatly into a small package to set aside when not in use.  However, lightweight does not mean it is not strong and durable.  The cover that came with our Weber charcoal grill is nearly the same weight and thickness of fabric, and it's seen constant use for 3 years. I expect the Leader Accessories cover to have the same durability.\n4.  The bottom of the fabric is elasticized, and there are two toggle buttons at the end of the elastic on opposite side.  Pull on the elastic end, slide the toggle button down to tighten the cover around the fire pit, and it locks in place.  Push the side of the toggle button in to slide the toggle button back up and loosen the elastic.\n5.  There are tiedown straps on opposite sides of the cover to securely tie the cover to the legs of the fire pit, especially important for us since we currently have a small firepit and this is a large cover.\n6.  There are fabric handles, one on each side of the cover, so it is easy to lift the cover off after you undo the tiedown straps and loosen the elastic bottom.\n7.  The cover comes with a large piece of the same fabric for repair if needed. The repair fabric has adhesive on one side; just cut to size, peel off the backing, and apply to cover.\nI will update this review in the spring after the cover has been in use through one winter. Our 29.92 inch black steel wood-burning fire pit sits outside on an uncovered back porch, and protection from all types of weather is critical so we don't have to buy a new one every couple of years.\nI received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  I depend on other reviewers to provide solid information about the product and truthful reviews, and I do the same after testing thoroughly.  If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.  If you look at my reviews, you'll see I review items I bought without a discount too.

HOWEVER, I must comment on the Miracle-Gro  sprayer I purchased to apply the lawn food (there are very few sprayers which will accept a granular product and dilute it in the sprayer).  I went through two of them before--both started leaking profusely out the business-end of the sprayer the first time I used them.  It finally dawned on me that my water pressure was too high for the sprayer (100 psi), and, upon disassembling one of the units, I discovered that a small O-ring in the valve had been displaced by the pressure.  I purchased a pressure-reducing adapter (from Amazon) which lowered the pressure and solved the problem.  I had to buy a third sprayer and it worked just fine.

Once the full size tank is placed on the stand, the cart is not that easy to move away from the house so I feel you need to leave the grill placed where you may grill safely.

I own a number of grow lights in various sizes and from different brands. What they all have in common is they are truly effective. I mainly grow basil and cilantro, and prefer to grow mine inside because weeds have always been an issue in my outdoors herb gardens.  Suffice to say that I am a fan of any grow light, regardless of which brand.\n\nWhat I particularly like about this one is the size. Many of my grow lights are much smaller and are better suited for getting a seedling started. This one is good for a fairly large pot (up to five gallons if you suspend this light a meter from the top of your herb or plant.) The suspension means that you will need a socket that can be raised or lowered so that when your plant grows the light can be raised to maintain a meter above height. You can be a little loser, but I have found that a meter is perfect for lights this size.\n\nThis light runs cool, so if you are using it in an enclosed space and you have more than one the thermal build-up should not be an issue. Some lights from other brands do tend to get hot and can (and will) change the room temperature in ventilated spaces that may hamper growth.\n\nOne factor that you need to take into account is this is a heavy light that weights in around a pound. It needs a sturdy suspension, and must be suspended vertically.","summary":"Effective light that is larger and heavier than many, but runs cool","unixReviewTime":1467072000,"style":null,"image":null}

After a too hot fire the felt we had on the grill burned up. We were having trouble keeping a steady temperature after that as we had not yet replaced the felt. We just procrastinated as the nearest dealer was an hour away and we were busy. We paid a higher price for the product sold by The Big Green Egg. We do regular grilling as well as slow cooking with smoke (up to 20 hours) at 205 degrees and we grill pizza at high temperatures.\n\nSmokeWare's felt works great and is easy to apply. It's a very good price. We love it.\n\nI received one unit of this product from SmokeWare to test and review.

Unlike the Toro I had previously used (also a good product, and reliable for many years, my parents still have it), with this one you can not only point the escape nozzle in the direction you want, you can also set how HIGH it throws.  This means that when you're throwing on the side of the drive next to your neighbor's house, you can make it throw right next to the drive, and not on their windows... but when you're pointing it towards someplace where you want the snow thrown further, it will throw up to 12'.\n\nI used it in a very heavy, wet snow, 8-10\" deep.  This means I could not just push it along like a baby stroller, I had to ram it against the snow.  But it was able to do the job, and the 100' drive as a lot easier than if I'd had to lift each heavy wet shovelful and toss it over my shoulder!","summary":"Worx served my needs well in heavy, wet, 8-10\" snow","unixReviewTime":1298160000,"style":null,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61cDn4Xb5DL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51ZooYRzCxL._SY88.jpg"]}

The GOOD:  Bottom + feet are sturdy enough. I do not think it could hold up to rough abuse but it did not bend and was not flimsy at all. The heat made it change color on 1st use but looks natural is is not unappealing. Plenty of air flow (something many others are missing), so wood scraps burned well in this. The square holes are screened-in too.  The top is a blessing because it keeps the lightweight embers from floating about and prevents unwanted fires external to the container. The metal rod is perfect for lifting the top on\/off while burning wood and prevents you from getting too close. The BAD: The top screen is super flimsy and one must be very careful with it. Once it gets hot, it becomes even more flimsy. While it fit perfect before use, it certainly is not so well fitting after using it for a few hours. However, we were careful enough and it works just fine for us.","summary":"Works!, bottom is good, top is just 'OK'","unixReviewTime":1426896000,"style":null,"image":null}

It put fertilizer right where I needed it and this year my wife's roses look great.\n\nThe weakest part of this unit is where the garden hose connects. I am a stickler for making sure the connections are not cross threaded and I had this one on tight when all at once the hose just popped out of the connector. I put it back on making sure that it was tight but not overtightened. Again the hose popped out. When I attempted to reattach the hose the third time the connector would not accept the hose fittings. It cannot be used at all now.\n\nI think part of what caused my problem was me carrying the unit around with the garden hose attached. Be sure and disconnect the hose after use.\n\nIf I were to purchase another I will attach a garden hose shut-off valve on it. That way I will not ruin the threads on the unit by constantly attaching and removing a garden hose from the unit itself I would be attaching it to the shut off valve instead.\n\nIf you are tempted to carry the unit around anyway with a garden hose attached I might have a solution for that too. I'd attach shut-off valve to the unit and reinforce it with duct tape. Maybe even wrap the tape around a couple of wooden dowels.

However; Amazon's price of $199 was way off. I bought this at a local big box home improvement store for less than $130.00. Can you say score! It holds the pool toys and floatation devices just fine. It doubles a s a seat for several people and guests. You can lock it but lets face it, one can easily cut the plastic and your in. The lock is to keep kids out at best. It doesn't offer much theft deterrence. Adding your own lock system might make it more theft resistant if you concern is security. I checked out all the boxes available and yes, I too find that Rubbermaid products warp and I have found Rubbermaid sold out and no longer is a trusted quality name just like other reviewers have mentioned. I found that many other available boxes were not as well built as this one and I could not find anything as large as this available. Lifetime makes several other products like those really strong folding tables and storage sheds. With a name like Lifetime, they better build tuff long lasting products to live up to the name and it has been my experience that they do. Id like to see seat cushions maybe recess the top to accept commonly available out door back yard type seat cushions. Maybe a back to it so its more useable as a seat. The back could fold away when not in use. There are products like that but they were way to small for my storage needs so I chose this box. Wheels would be nice too. Would make it easier especially when full to move it about to clean. Of course with wheels you would need recessed handles as well. All in all its a storage box and it performs that function well. 4 stars, do to the lack of details that I would like to see and the usual customer no service.\n\nUPDATE: 7 months old and it's still like new!

Not withstanding any bad reviews you might have read, this is a good product.  I have an 18' round by 52\" deep pool and this vacuum works extremely well.  I was looking at much more expensive products but this one works just as well and, because it's from Intex, it had a better chance or working with my Intex pool.  I had tried another, very expensive, item and had to return it because my pump didn't have the power it needed when my filter got clogged with debris.  I have a sand filter and that other model was hooked up to the intake line so the debris was sent straight to the sand filter.  This model is hooked up to the return line so the dirt doesn't get to the sand filter directly.  The dirt and debris gets caught in a catch basin inside the vacuum and it has a fine mesh screen that keeps the dirt from going back into the pool.  At first it doesn't seem to be working but as you watch it going about the pool, you start to see it picking up the debris and dirt from the floor.  It has an erratic pattern but it does cover the entire pool bottom. I cleaned the vacuum after the first day of cleaning (6 hours) and I was surprised at the amount of dirt the vacuum had in the catch basin.  I have put away my manual vacuum hose and attachments because this vacuum seems to be working just fine.  It's been running for a few days now and I hope to keep it going for a few seasons. I read many bad reviews from people who stated it doesn't work.  I gave it a try because I'm very mechanically inclined and can fix pretty much anything.  I sometimes wonder what people do to install the item when items don't work for them.  Either way, for every bad review, there are probably 100+ satisfied customers.  The good reviews were very informative and, now that I have used this product, I feel that those good reviews were right on point.\n\nI will say that the hoses need to be installed in their specified manner.  There are two types of hoses (labed B and C) and they have to be installed in alternating fashion because only one of those hoses has a swivel joint.  I read that someone had to keep untangling his hose; I haven't had that issue and my vacuum is running with a solar cover on the top of the water.  The hose untangles itself if you install the hoses correctly.\n\nOne reviewer stated that they put their pump on recirculate and that's a good idea if your pump doesn't have the power to run the vacuum. I like to have any debris that gets kicked up by the vacuum picked up by the intake and filtered by the sand.  My pump pressure does go into the yellow\/green area but the vacuum still zips around the pool doing it's job.\n\nUPDATE: Here we are a few months later and this vacuum is working perfectly.\n\n2nd UPDATE: We are in our second season with this vacuum and it's still working perfectly. I would also recommend replacing the metal hose clamps with plastic hose clamps. We have a salt pool and the clamps started rusting by the middle of the first season","summary":"I rarely give five stars to a product.","unixReviewTime":1503100800,"style":{"Size:":" 1 Pack"},"image":null}

Don't count on this thing to be a solar charger, more like a decent battery bank with emergency solar capability.\n\nI put it to an honest test and have concluded that it performs well for such a small cell.\n\nMost people don't fully understand that getting useable power for charging out of a single solar cell is no small task. These cells put out maybe a watt and a half on a good day. I tested by putting in direct sun(angled toward the sun) at a point where the sun would clear an obstruction at exactly the same time every day and hit the panel with full sun. total sun time per day was approx 6hrs. After 4 days, I was up to the second power bar. I was originally unimpressed by this.\n\nThen I began depleting back down to 0 power and the point that it would not turn on and charge anything unless pointed directly at the sun. It took over 3 hrs from the second power level, charging a Samsung Galaxy S5 and an Earson BT Speaker both connected streaming netflix.\n\nI further tested by trying to power a phone that would not turn on with the charger that would not stay on unless pointed directly at the sun. I was actually able to make a phone call.\n\nAs Far as the Weather Proofness; it is not. While there are rubber flaps to shed water, they don't seal completely and there are large holed behind the rubber bumpers. See video for more details.\n\nSo the conclusion is: This thing is worth taking on a backpacking trip for light daily or emergency use and works well as a Battery Bank, but is not a full blown solar charger.

The small rocks were all kicked up to the top where I could pick them up. It bounced on the brick and i used a shovel to dig it up. The other bed was a long strip along a fence with no grass. It did a great job of tilling this up and I was very happy with the results. I used a fifty foot 12 gauge extension cord and had no overheating problems and the breaker never tripped as some have reported.

I have used Miracle Gro potting soil in the past with good results, but I was feeling too lazy to drive to the home improvement store to buy it, so I ordered on Amazon.\n\nThe quality of the soil I received was excellent.  There were very few large pieces and no gnats.  It was easy to scoop out with a pot or a trowel and it holds moisture very well (so make sure your pots have adequate drainage and don't water your plants too often).  The seedlings I transplanted into this soil are thriving thus far.  My past experience with this soil has been that the fertilizers it already contains are good enough for one growing season, at least, so you don't need to add more fertilizer.  Also, if you don't use it all up, it will usually last more than a year in the bag, although opened bags may dry out a bit.\n\nI would caution you to be careful what you're ordering when it comes to package size, since there are many package sizes with many different measurement units available on this page.  I had no idea what the sizes of the bags I had bought in previous years were, so I ordered what I thought was the biggest bag (2.5 cubic feet).

I was looking for a couple of the best feeders I could find.  These were very well-reviewed, and they were made of glass.\n\nThe bottles are heavy-grade quality glass with screw-on hanger tops.  The bottlenecks are very narrow, which makes cleaning difficult, particularly if any mold has developed inside the bottle.  Also, these are almost impossible to fill  without a funnel.\n\nThe feeder base is red plastic with snap-in flower feeders, and they are prone to leak.  Worse, quite a variety of flying bugs and ants are able to get inside the feeder.  The feeder base does not come apart, so you can only keep rinsing until the dead bugs stop floating out.  You can't see the inside edges of the feeder to see if it's clean enough.  After about a year, the plastic flowers started breaking, so I gave up and tossed both feeders.\n\nCuriously, when I first ordered these and was waiting for them to arrive, I picked up a cheap little plastic feeder at a local store.  Not only am I still using it, I just bought four more.  They're made by First Nature, and they come apart completely for cleaning.  Bugs don't seem to get inside these, either.  They were less than half the price of this model, and the hummingbirds like them a lot.","summary":"Hard to fill, hard to clean, leaky, and buggy","unixReviewTime":1288051200,"style":{"Size:":" 1 Pack"},"image":null}

Unfortunately my experience so far with pumps like those is they have a short life (if they turn on intermittently) or the trigger to turn them on when the water level rises is unreliable.  As a result I use an intermittent pump and they frequently fail - typically once to twice per year!! (They have a 3 year warranty though and the manufacture just sends me a new one for free each time to their credit)  Anyway, I use this pump as a back up when my main intermittent pump fails and I'm waiting for a replacement in the mail.  This pump worked great.  The biggest problem for me, of course, is that I have to turn it on and off manually.  It failed after I left it on too long while draining my cover.  That was my fault but it was on for only 30-60 seconds after water was drained.  That killed the pump which is disappointing.

I have used many deck boxes over the years, but this Keter deck box is truly a real piece of patio furniture.  Quality shock type hinges, not plastic hinges, has a bracket for a masterlock, absolute sturdiness you could dance on it. Closes easily, no slamming down, very easy to lift the lid.  Adds an area on your patio for up to three or four people to sit.  Gorgeous deep chocolate color. (I hate that my deck looks so bad against this box in my pictures, but starting that stain project again soon.)\nI am undecided on what I want to put in this box so buying another one.  I plan to use one in the horse barn tack room to store washed folded winter horse blankets.  Actually this would be nice to use indoors to store human winter blankets too, or even use for a toy box. Or even a dorm room to virtually store most belongings and use for seating. Also could use for folded pool towels, and pool maintenance equipment.  Once you get one of these you are going to start wanting to use them for other uses than on the deck.","summary":"Completely surprised by this deck box.","unixReviewTime":1490572800,"style":null,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81Sox9z9IyL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/819Zcu3JFkL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Puk9l2W1L._SY88.jpg"]}

Frankly, I loved it.  With the small size and the power that it had, I was able to till up lawn and create garden space.  I wrote a glowing review here on Amazon.  But after about six or seven years it died on me.  I was going to have it repaired, but instead saw a refurbished model of the Sun Joe here on Amazon.  I figured the total price would be less than the repairs on my old one, so I gave it a shot.  This thing is a little monster!  For starters, it's 50% wider than the Troy-Bilt was, so it gets the job done a lot faster, and all with no less digging power (despite using two extra tines by comparison).  I like the wider handles as compared to my old ones narrow grasp. I've dug up all kinds of beds and garden spaces, plowed into my huge compost pile and spare dirt pile and it just keeps churning and breaking down everything.  No rock jams at all after using it last fall and this spring.  One minor inconvenience is that the tines don't come off easily for cleaning\/clearing, but I've been able to unwrap roots by hand to clear it out with them still mounted.  I'd say it's a fair price at the normal rate, but the deal I got on the refurbished model was an absolute steal.","summary":"Absolutely Tough","unixReviewTime":1398211200,"style":{"Color:":" Black"},"image":null}

Other users had recommended the need to unroll it and leave it in the sun. They are spot on. It makes it so much easier to work with. It does get slight waves in it if the day is very hot, but as I have mulch right up to the edge and flowers that will fill the space, I do not feel that detracted from the quality of the product at all. I feel it looks much better than the black borders I had used before. I did use the Terrace Board stakes that are recommended for it and I couldn't imagine putting the board down without it. It is incredibly hard and can be difficult to cut. I used both a little saw and Kitchen shears to see which would work better. If you know exactly how much you need and can saw it, that would be best. I sawed and then lightly sanded to smooth the edges. There were some areas that I was adding curves to and wasn't sure of the exact length I would need in the end but was able to use the shears. The shears were fortunately strong enough even though my hand begged me to stop.
